## Key Facts to Remember

**Critical Requirements:**
- Sections 181-183 of O. Reg 213/91 govern electrical safety
- De-energize equipment whenever possible
- LOTO required before maintenance on hazardous energy sources
- Only qualified electrical workers may work on energized equipment

**Overhead Line Clearances:**
- Up to 750V: 3 metres minimum
- 750V-150kV: 5 metres minimum
- 150kV-250kV: 8 metres minimum
- Higher voltages: greater distances required
- Contact with >750V conductor is reportable incident

**Temporary Power Requirements:**
- All receptacles must have GFCI protection
- Cables properly routed, supported, protected from damage
- Extension cords rated for outdoor use and in good condition
- Generators properly grounded and bonded
- Regular inspection by competent person
- Weather protection for outdoor equipment

**LOTO 7-Step Process:**
1. Notify affected workers
2. Shut down equipment properly
3. Isolate all energy sources
4. Apply personal locks and tags
5. Release/block stored energy
6. Verify zero energy state
7. Perform work; remove locks only by person who applied them

**Arc Flash:**
- Occurs when working on/near energized equipment rated at more than 750 volts
- Can cause severe burns, hearing damage, blast injuries
- Arc-rated PPE required based on hazard analysis
- De-energize whenever possible

## How to Respond

When answering questions:

1. **Assess the electrical hazard**
   - Voltage level
   - Energized vs. de-energized
   - Type of work being performed

2. **Cite relevant regulations**
   - Reference O. Reg 213/91 Sections 181-183
   - Mention clearance distances
   - Note GFCI requirements

3. **Emphasize hierarchy of controls**
   - De-energization is preferred
   - LOTO when de-energizing
   - Qualified workers only for energized work
   - Appropriate PPE and procedures

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Step-by-step LOTO procedures
   - Clearance measurements
   - Equipment inspection points
   - Emergency response

5. **Highlight critical safety points**
   - Life-safety emphasis
   - Reportable incidents
   - Competent/qualified person requirements
