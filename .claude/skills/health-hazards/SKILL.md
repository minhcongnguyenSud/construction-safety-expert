## Key Regulations

**O. Reg 490/09 - Designated Substances:**
11 designated substances including:
- Asbestos
- Lead
- Silica (crystalline)
- Benzene
- Mercury
- Vinyl chloride
- And others

**Section 30 OHSA - Lead:**
- Owner must identify presence of lead
- Must inform all contractors
- Required before work begins

## Critical Requirements

### Asbestos
**Identification:**
- Survey required before demolition/renovation of pre-1990 buildings
- Only designated workers may handle asbestos
- Type 1, 2, or 3 operations depending on friability

**Controls:**
- Wet methods for dust suppression
- Containment and negative pressure
- Proper respiratory protection
- Disposal in sealed containers
- Medical surveillance for workers

### Silica Dust
**Hazards:**
- Crystalline silica causes silicosis (lung disease)
- Found in: concrete, brick, stone, sand
- Generated by: cutting, grinding, drilling, demolishing

**Controls:**
- Water suppression (wet cutting)
- HEPA vacuums with dust collection
- Respiratory protection when needed
- Fit testing for respirators
- Medical surveillance
- Minimize dust generation

### Lead (Section 30 OHSA)
**Owner Duties:**
- Identify lead presence BEFORE work starts
- Inform all contractors in writing
- Common in: old paint, pipes, solder

**Worker Protection:**
- Lead risk assessments required
- Air monitoring for exposure
- Respiratory protection
- Blood lead testing
- Proper decontamination procedures
- No eating/drinking in contaminated areas

### Noise
**Requirements:**
- Exposure limit: 85 dBA time-weighted average
- Hearing protection required >85 dBA
- Hearing conservation program for continuous exposure
- Annual audiometric testing
- Engineering controls preferred (quieter tools)

### Heat Stress
**Prevention:**
- Drink water every 15-20 minutes
- Frequent breaks in shade
- Acclimatization period (7-14 days)
- Recognize signs: heat cramps, exhaustion, stroke
- Buddy system monitoring
- Adjust work schedule for extreme heat

### Cold Stress
**Prevention:**
- Layer clothing (moisture-wicking base)
- Protect extremities
- Frequent warm-up breaks
- Stay dry (wet clothing loses insulation)
- Recognize frostbite and hypothermia
- Heated shelters available

### Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs)
**Common Issues:**
- Back injuries from lifting
- Shoulder/arm strain from overhead work
- Hand/wrist issues from repetitive tasks
- Knee problems from kneeling

**Prevention:**
- Proper lifting techniques
- Mechanical aids for heavy loads
- Task rotation and job variety
- Ergonomic tool selection
- Adequate rest breaks
- Early reporting of symptoms

**Manual Handling Limits:**
- General limit: 23 kg (50 lbs) for most workers
- Lower limits for awkward positions
- Use team lifts or mechanical aids above limits

## How to Respond

When answering questions:

1. **Identify the specific health hazard**
   - Chemical, physical, or biological
   - Acute vs. chronic exposure
   - Severity and regulatory requirements

2. **Cite specific regulations**
   - O. Reg 490/09 for designated substances
   - Section 30 OHSA for lead
   - WHMIS 2015 for chemicals
   - Note medical surveillance requirements

3. **Provide hierarchy of controls**
   - Elimination (remove hazard)
   - Substitution (less hazardous material)
   - Engineering controls (ventilation, water suppression)
   - Administrative controls (work procedures, rotation)
   - PPE (respirators, hearing protection) - last resort

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Exposure assessment methods
   - Control implementation steps
   - PPE selection and fit testing
   - Medical surveillance requirements
   - Training needs

5. **Emphasize critical safety points**
   - Chronic health effects develop over time
   - Medical surveillance catches early signs
   - Engineering controls preferred over PPE
   - Owner duties under Section 30 (lead)
   - Pre-1990 buildings may contain asbestos
