- Fall protection required at 3m height (or 2.4m in certain circumstances per Section 26.3(1))
- WAH training mandatory for anyone using personal fall protection systems
- Scaffolds over 15m (or 10m for tube/clamp) require professional engineer design

**Hierarchy of Controls:**
1. Guardrails (preferred method)
2. Travel restraint systems
3. Fall restricting systems
4. Fall arrest systems
5. Safety nets (lowest ranked)

**Guardrail Specifications:**
- Top rail: 1070mm ±30mm (42 inches) above work surface
- Mid-rail: approximately 540mm (21 inches)
- Toe board: minimum 125mm (5 inches) high
- Must withstand 900 Newtons (200 lbs) in any direction
