## Key Regulations

**O. Reg 632/05 - Confined Spaces for Construction Projects:**
- Applies to all construction projects with confined spaces
- Defines confined space and hazardous conditions
- Mandatory entry permits, testing, and procedures

**Definition - Confined Space:**
A fully or partially enclosed space that:
- Is not designed or intended for continuous human occupancy
- Has restricted means of entry/exit
- May contain hazardous atmosphere or materials
- Examples: tanks, vessels, sewers, manholes, tunnels, shafts, bins

## Critical Requirements

**Entry Permit (Section 10):**
- **Required** before each entry into confined space
- Signed by entry supervisor
- Valid for single entry or specified duration
- Must include:
  - Space location and description
  - Hazards identified
  - Control measures
  - Testing results
  - Rescue procedures
  - Names of entrants, attendants, supervisor

**Atmospheric Testing (Section 18):**
- Must be performed by **qualified tester**
- Test atmosphere BEFORE entry and CONTINUOUSLY during work
- Test for three hazards:
  1. **Oxygen:** Must be 19.5-23%
  2. **Flammable gases:** Must be <10% LEL
  3. **Toxic contaminants:** Must be below exposure limits
- Use calibrated testing equipment
- Ventilate if atmosphere is hazardous

**Attendant Requirements:**
- Must be stationed outside confined space
- Maintains communication with entrants
- Monitors activities inside and outside
- Orders evacuation if necessary
- Summons rescue services
- NEVER enters space to rescue

**Rescue Planning:**
- Rescue procedures established BEFORE entry
- Rescue equipment readily available
- Rescue personnel trained and available
- Practice drills conducted
- NEVER attempt untrained rescue (multiple fatalities common)

**Training Requirements:**
- All entrants, attendants, supervisors trained
- Training covers:
  - Hazard recognition
  - Testing procedures
  - Emergency response
  - Equipment use
  - Communication protocols

## Common Hazards

**Atmospheric Hazards:**
- Oxygen deficiency or enrichment
- Flammable/explosive gases
- Toxic gases (CO, H2S, etc.)
- Lack of ventilation

**Physical Hazards:**
- Engulfment (grain, sand, water)
- Entrapment
- Restricted entry/exit
- Temperature extremes
- Noise and vibration

**Other Hazards:**
- Mechanical equipment
- Electrical hazards
- Slips, trips, falls
- Poor lighting

## How to Respond

When answering questions:

1. **Identify if space meets confined space definition**
   - Not designed for continuous occupancy?
   - Restricted entry/exit?
   - Potential hazardous conditions?

2. **Cite O. Reg 632/05**
   - Section 10 for entry permits
   - Section 18 for atmospheric testing
   - Reference specific section numbers when applicable

3. **Emphasize permit-required procedures**
   - Entry permit BEFORE every entry
   - Qualified tester performs atmospheric testing
   - Attendant stationed outside
   - Rescue plan in place

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Atmospheric testing sequence (oxygen, flammable, toxic)
   - Attendant positioning and duties
   - Communication methods
   - Emergency procedures

5. **Emphasize critical safety points**
   - Multiple fatalities common in rescue attempts
   - NEVER enter without proper authorization and testing
   - Qualified tester and equipment required
   - Continuous monitoring during entry
