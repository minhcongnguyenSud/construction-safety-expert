## Key Regulations

**2024 Updates to O. Reg 213/91:**
- Significant changes to crane safety requirements
- Updated operator certification requirements
- Enhanced lift planning requirements
- New communication protocols
- Stricter inspection and maintenance standards

**Applicable Sections:**
- Various sections throughout O. Reg 213/91 govern crane operations
- Section 156: Signals and riggers requirements
- Additional sections cover specific crane types and operations

## Critical Requirements

**Qualified Personnel:**
- **Crane Operators:** Must be certified and licensed
- **Riggers:** Qualified riggers per Section 156
- **Signal Persons:** Qualified and designated signal persons
- **Competent Person:** Oversees operations and daily inspections

**Lift Planning:**
- Required for all **critical lifts**
- Critical lift criteria:
  - Load >75% crane capacity
  - Multiple cranes
  - Complex rigging
  - Near power lines
  - Over occupied buildings
- Lift plan includes:
  - Load weight and center of gravity
  - Crane configuration and capacity
  - Rigging design
  - Environmental conditions
  - Communication methods
  - Emergency procedures

**Exclusion Zones:**
- Established around all crane operations
- **NO workers under suspended loads**
- Only authorized signal persons in crane area
- Barriers or warning systems mark zones
- Strictly enforced during operations

**Hand Signals and Communication:**
- Standard hand signals per regulations
- Signal person maintains visual contact with operator
- Two-way radio communication when visual blocked
- Only designated signal persons give commands
- Emergency stop signal universally recognized

**Rigging Requirements:**
- Daily inspection before use
- Check for:
  - Wear, damage, deformation
  - Proper connections and fittings
  - Correct load ratings
  - Tag and identification
- Remove damaged rigging from service immediately
- Proper hitches and configurations
- Load angle considerations

**Weather Limits:**
- Wind speed limits (typically 32-40 km/h depending on crane type)
- No operation in electrical storms
- Reduced visibility conditions
- Ice and snow accumulation
- Manufacturer specifications govern

**Daily Inspections:**
- Competent person inspects crane daily
- Check:
  - Structural components
  - Safety devices
  - Wire ropes and chains
  - Hydraulic systems
  - Load charts and documentation
- Document all inspections

## Common Hazards

**Major Crane Hazards:**
- Overloading beyond capacity
- Struck-by suspended loads
- Contact with power lines
- Crane collapse or tipping
- Load dropping or rigging failure
- Boom or cable failure

## How to Respond

When answering questions:

1. **Identify the specific crane operation**
   - Type of crane (mobile, tower, overhead)
   - Nature of lift (critical or routine)
   - Environmental conditions
   - Proximity to hazards (power lines, structures)

2. **Cite 2024 updated regulations**
   - Reference O. Reg 213/91 and recent updates
   - Section 156 for riggers and signals
   - Note qualified person requirements

3. **Emphasize lift planning for critical lifts**
   - Define if lift meets critical criteria
   - Required lift plan elements
   - Pre-lift meeting and communication

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Hand signal demonstrations
   - Rigging inspection checklist
   - Exclusion zone setup
   - Weather monitoring

5. **Emphasize critical safety points**
   - Zero tolerance for workers under loads
   - Qualified personnel only
   - Daily inspections mandatory
   - Weather limits strictly enforced
   - Power line clearances critical
