## Key Statistics

**Critical Facts:**
- 13% of workplace fatalities in Ontario over past decade
- 359 critical injuries and 38 fatalities (2018-2022)
- Major causes: mobile equipment, traffic incidents, crane loads, falling materials

## Critical Requirements

**Mobile Equipment Safety:**
- Operators must have clear visibility or use spotters
- Backup alarms required on all mobile equipment
- High-visibility clothing mandatory for workers on foot
- Only trained and authorized operators may operate equipment
- Equipment must be inspected daily

**Traffic Control (Sections 67-69):**
- Traffic control plans required for vehicle/worker interaction
- Vehicle routes and pedestrian walkways must be separated
- Warning signs and barricades protect workers
- Traffic control persons properly trained and visible
- Speed limits enforced on construction sites

**Crane Operations:**
- Exclusion zones established around crane operations
- No workers under suspended loads
- Only authorized signal persons in crane area
- Loads must not swing over workers
- Daily inspection of rigging equipment

**Falling Objects:**
- Materials and tools secured to prevent falling from heights
- Toe boards, screens, or guardrails at edges
- Overhead protection, barriers, or exclusion zones for workers below
- Material storage organized to prevent tipping/rolling/collapsing
- Hard hats mandatory at all times

**Backing Vehicles:**
- Functional backup alarms on all mobile equipment
- Spotters required when backing near workers or in congested areas

   - PPE (hard hats, high-visibility clothing)

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Traffic control plan elements
   - Spotter communication procedures
   - Equipment inspection points
