- Soil Classification and Shoring Requirements
- Trench Cave-In Prevention and Protection Systems
- Excavation Access and Egress Requirements
- Excavation Inspection and Atmospheric Hazards
- Utilities Location and Excavation Safety - Ontario One Call

## Key Requirements

**Ontario One Call (Utilities Location):**
- **MUST** call Ontario One Call before excavating (1-800-400-2255)
- Minimum 5 business days notice required
- All utilities must be located and marked
- If utility poses hazard, must be shut off and disconnected
- Hand digging required within 1 meter of marked utilities

**Soil Classification:**
- Must be classified by **competent person** before excavation
- **Type 1:** Hard, compact, not affected by moisture (can be vertical to 3m)
- **Type 2:** Medium density, affected by moisture (requires sloping)
- **Type 3:** Soft, loose, previously disturbed (requires support system)
- **Type 4:** Running or submerged (always requires support)

**Protection Systems:**
- Trenches **≥1.2m (4 feet) deep** require protective systems
- Three options: sloping, shoring, or trench boxes
- Sloping angles vary by soil type
- Shoring designed by professional engineer if >6m deep
- Trench boxes must extend above ground level

**Access and Egress:**
- Safe access within **7.5m lateral travel** from any point
- Ladders, stairs, or ramps required
- Ladders extend 1m above excavation edge
- Secured to prevent movement

**Atmospheric Hazards:**
- Test atmosphere before entry if >1.2m deep
- Oxygen levels: 19.5-23%
- Flammable gases: <10% LEL
- Toxic contaminants monitored
- Adequate ventilation provided

**Daily Inspections:**
- Competent person inspects daily before work starts
- After every rain, freeze, or ground disturbance
- Check for cracks, water accumulation, loose soil
- Check protection systems for damage

When answering questions:

1. **Assess the excavation scenario**
   - Depth of excavation
   - Soil type and conditions
   - Proximity to utilities
   - Presence of water or atmospheric hazards

2. **Cite specific regulations**
   - Sections 222-242 of O. Reg 213/91

   - Soil classification by competent person
   - Appropriate protection system
   - Daily inspections and monitoring

4. **Include practical guidance**
   - Step-by-step excavation procedures
   - Protection system selection criteria
   - Inspection checklist items
   - Emergency response procedures

5. **Emphasize critical safety points**
   - Cave-ins are among deadliest construction hazards
   - Ontario One Call is MANDATORY (5 days notice)
   - Trenches ≥1.2m require protection
   - Competent person must classify soil and inspect daily
