The shock disrupts the heart’s electrical activity long enough for it to spontaneously develop an effective rhythm on its own. Using an AED as soon as possible (along with starting CPR immediately) gives the person the best chance of surviving cardiac arrest. Different types of AEDs are available, but all are similar to operate and guide you using visual displays, voice prompts, or both. If your place of employment has an AED on site, know where it is located, how to operate it, and what the procedures around it are (e.g., for reporting its use or replacing its batteries). Also take note of the location of AEDs in public places that you frequent, such as shopping centres, airports, recreation centres, and sports arenas. In more than 80% of all sudden cardiac deaths, the person’s heart rhythm is \"shockable\" (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). In other words, defibrillation could have helped. If the person’s heart has no electrical activity (asystole or flatline), defibrillation won’t help. For each minute that the person has to wait for defibrillation, the chance of survival drops between 7 and 10%.1. Open and turn on the AED. 2. Prepare to apply the AED pads: • Remove or cut away clothing and undergarments to expose the person’s chest, and move or remove any objects (including jewellery) that could come into contact with the • If the person’s chest is wet, dry it using a towel or gauze pad.

Burns from Lightning Strikes The following precautions will help prevent burns from lightning strikes: • As soon as a storm is seen or heard, stop swimming or boating and get away from the water, because water conducts electricity. • Stay indoors during thunderstorms. A picnic shelter or car (with the windows rolled up) will also provide some protection. • If caught outside, stay away from telephone poles and tall trees. Stay off hilltops and try to crouch down in a ravine or valley if shelters are not available nearby. • Stay away from things that conduct electricity, such as farm equipment, small metal vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, bicycles, and golf carts), wire fences, clotheslines, metal pipes, and railings. Thermal Burns The following precautions will help prevent thermal burns: • When cooking on the stove, turn the pot handles in and use only the back burners when possible. • Keep the hot water tank temperature at or below 49°C (120°F). • Keep children away from heat sources and appliances such as ovens, barbecues, space heaters, woodstoves, candles, and fireplaces. • Keep hot drinks out of children’s reach.Any of the following signs around an injury may indicate an infection: • Red streaks moving away from the wound • Heat or warmth • Swelling • Tenderness • Excessive itchiness Burns are soft-tissue injuries caused by chemicals, electricity, heat, or radiation. Prevention There are different methods of prevention for different types of burns. Chemical Burns The following precautions will help prevent chemical burns: • Store chemicals in their original containers. • Wear protective gear when handling chemicals. • Wash your hands after touching chemicals. • Get trained in a hazardous materials training program, such as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS)/ Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. • Read the label before using a product. • Be aware of caustic plants in your area.

Look for two burns (the entry and exit points) and care for them as you would care for thermal burns. Radiation Burns The most common type of radiation burn is a sunburn, but they can also be caused by exposure to radioactive substances. What to Do 1. If the burn results from exposure to a radioactive substance, consult the appropriate workplace safety system (e.g., WHMIS) for specific first aid steps. 2. Care for radiation burns as you would care for thermal burns.Special Considerations When Caring for Burns Remember the following special considerations when providing care for burns: • Don’t use ointments on partial or full thickness burns. • Blisters are a natural cooling system. Leave them in place. • Touch a burn only with sterile or clean dressings. • Do not use absorbent cotton or pull clothes over any burned area. Pay close attention to the person’s airway. Look for signs of burn injuries around the face. If you suspect that the airway or the lungs may be burned, monitor the person’s breathing closely. A bruise is a discoloured area of the skin that is created when blood and other fluids seep into nearby tissues. What to Look For The following are signs and symptoms of bruising: • Discoloured skin (red, purple, black, or blue areas) • Swelling • PainElectrical Burns Electrical burns are caused by powerful electrical currents. They are typically caused by a person either touching a live electrical circuit or being struck by lightning. Because electricity and lightning can affect the heart, it is important to monitor the person’s ABCs closely. Wound Care94.",

There is potential for the worker to receive an arc flash burn, thermal burn, or blastinjury. Note: An electric hazard is considered to be removed when protective measures are putin place at the source (remove hazard or de-energize), or along the path (place electricalinsulation/barrier between the worker andthe electrical hazard). Where PPE is reliedupon for worker protection, an electricalhazard is considered to remain and it is stillnecessary to address safety requirements forother workers in the area. Injuries resulting from a worker makingelectrical contact represent a relatively smallportion (7.7%) of the lost-time injurieselectricians experience, according to 1997–1999statistics. It is reasonable to assume that thesituation is similar today. Other mechanicaltrades that do some electrical work canprobably expect even fewer electrical injuries. Nevertheless, working on or near electricalhazards is dangerous and can be fatal. Anywork on or near energized equipment must bedone only when measures are in place toprovide protection from electric shock and burn.With adequate safety measures in place, everyelectrical injury and fatality can be prevented. The law requires safe work practices. Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act andRegulations for Construction Projects , employers, supervisors, and workers each have legalresponsibilities to ensure that work is beingcarried out in a safe manner. There are also restrictions in the Construction Regulation (Ontario Regulation 213/91 Section182) on who can work on electrical equipment: (1) No worker shall connect, maintain, or modify electrical equipment or installationsunless, (a) the worker is an electrician certified under the Trades Qualification andApprenticeship Act; or (b) the worker is otherwise permitted to connect, maintain or modify electricalequipment or installations under theTrades Qualification and ApprenticeshipAct, the Apprenticeship and CertificationAct, 1998 or the Technical Standardsand Safety Act, 2000. (2) A worker who does not meet the requirements of clause (1) (a) or (b) mayinsert an attachment plug cap on the cordof electrical equipment or an electrical toolinto, or remove it from, a conveniencereceptacle. Guidelines for working on or near electricalequipment and conductors are found in severaldocuments: • Construction Regulation (O. Reg. 213/91) •Ontario Electrical Safety Code.",

An important aspect of electrical work involves isolating electrical energy. A reference fordetailed information on lockout and control ofhazardous energy is the Canadian standard CSAZ460-05, Control of Hazardous Energy—Lockout and Other Methods. ELECTRICAL INJURIES There are basically two ways to be injured byelectricity. One is by electric shock and theother is by arc flash. Electric shock is the passing of electric current through the body. Electrical contact can causeinvoluntary physical movements. The electricalcurrent may • prevent you from releasing your grip from a live conductor • throw you into contact with a higher voltage conductor • cause you to lose your balance and fall • cause severe internal and external burns• kill you. A household 125-volt circuit can deliver 15 amps. Current as low as 30/1000 of 1 amp (30 mA) can cause breathing to stop. A 15-Amp circuit contains many times the currentneeded to cause death.An arc flash is a release of energy caused by anelectric arc. The flashcauses an explosiveexpansion of air andmetal. The blast produces • a dangerous pressure • a dangerous sound • shrapnel • extreme heat• extreme light. These dangers can result in blast injuries, lunginjuries, rupturedeardrums, shrapnelwounds, severe burns, andblindness. Arc flash injuriescan also result in death. A major cause of accidents involving electricity comes from the failure to identify the hazards associated with live electrical equipment and wiring. Arc flashElectric arc.",

Reusable custom-fit ear plugs are available to provide protection for specificfrequencies of noise. These provide a goodseal and can be washed and reused. 3. Earmuffs. They need to be fitted to provide maximum protection. Shock protection The passage of electricity through the body iscalled shock. Effects can range from a tinglingsensation to death.

Provide a sign meeting the Normal phase-to-phase voltage rating Minimum distance 750 or more volts, but no more than 150,000 volts 3 metres More than 150,000 volts, but no more than 250,000 volts 4.5 metres More than 250,000 volts 6 metres The wind can blow powerlines, hoist lines, or your load. This can cause them to cross the minimumdistance. POWERLINES OVERHEAD 72000 V.",

Electrical power linesoverhead.” We recommend that youinclude the voltage. • Ensure the equipment operator has been provided with written notification of theelectrical hazard before beginning the work. • Ensure there is a sign warning of the hazard that is visible to the operator at theoperator’s station. This may come as asticker with the machine. Check to ensurethe sticker is still legible. • Before the operator starts work, ensure that the employer of the equipmentoperator provides and explains theprocedures to the equipment operator. • A competent worker must be designated as a signaller to warn the operator when anypart of the equipment, load, or hoist linemay approach the minimum distance. Thesignaller must then be in full view of theoperator and have a clear view of theequipment and the conductor. Section 106of the Construction Regulation also applieswith respect to the designated signaller. An exemption to these measures is only allowedif under the authority of the owner of theelectrical conductor (typically the local utility),protective devices and equipment are installed,and written procedures are implemented (forexample, using the Electrical & Utilities SafetyAssociation (E&USA)’s Electrical Utilities SafetyRules) that are adequate to protect the equipmentoperator from electrical shock and burn. Prevention Ensure that contractors and workers understandthat work should be planned to avoidpowerlines. Prepare forwork that must be donein close proximity toenergized powerlines bydeveloping writtenprocedures ahead oftime. Have overheadpowerlines moved,insulated, or de-energizedwhere possible.Insulating or “rubberizing” powerlines offerssome protection against brush contact in somecircumstances. The local utility may provide thisservice. Identify the voltage of the service by checking markings on the utility pole and calling theutility. If material must be stored underpowerlines, hang warning flags and signs toinform workers about the hazard and the needto obtain written procedures if hoisting. Provide instruction as part of site orientation: • Advise operators of large equipment where overhead and buried powerlines are and where overhead powerlines may be lowerthan expected. • Remind workers not to let a ladder, scaffold, or elevated work platform lean ordrift toward overhead powerlines. Alwaysmaintain minimum allowable clearances. • Inform all workers how powerline hazards are identified on site and that written Inside the limit of approach to the powerline.",

In the event of contact betweenequipment and overhead powerlines: 1.Stay on equipment . Don’t touch equipment and the ground at the sametime. Touching anything in contact withthe ground can be fatal. Stay on theequipment unless forced off because of alife-threatening hazard such as fire. Keep others away . Warn everyone not to touch the equipment or its load. Thatincludes buckets, outriggers, load lines,and any other part of the machine. Bewareof time-delayed relays. After line damagetrips a breaker, relays may still try torestore power. They may resetautomatically two or three times. Break contact . If possible, break contact by moving the equipment clear of thewires. This may not be feasible wherecontact has welded conductors toequipment, the hoist line, or the load. Call the local utility . Get someone to call the local electrical utility for help. Stayon the equipment until the utility shutsdown the line and confirms that power is off. Report incidents of powerline contactso that the utility can check for damagethat could cause the line to fail later. Jump clear . If forced to leave the equipment, jump carefully off the equipment onto the ground landing onlyon your feet, with your feet together. Touching the equipment and theground at the same time can be fatal. Touching the ground at different pointscan also be fatal. Shuffle slowly away fromthe equipment using very small steps tominimize the contact area with the ground. Report the contact. See “Reporting Electrical Accidents/Incidents” in thischapter. Hidden power supplies Digging into buried cable resulted in 282powerline contacts between 1998 and 2005 (seeTable 1). A great many of these resulted fromexcavating prior to getting a locate on theservice. If the electrical power cannot be shutoff during excavation, the owner (of the service)must be present to supervise the uncovering ofthe powerline. The following are some prevention measures for hidden powerlines. For underground powerlines: • Before excavating, request that the owner of the service locate and mark underground powerlines. • Contact the utility through Ontario One Call to locate all underground services. • Locate and mark underground lines on drawings that will be used for excavating. • Post warning signs along the route of underground powerlines. • When operators of excavation equipment arrive on site, advise them whereunderground services are located and howthey are identified.",

MULTIMETERS In the process of troubleshooting, electricalworkers face the risk of injury from impropermultimeter selection or use. Multimeters that aredesigned to meet the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 1010 andovervoltage category standards, when properlyused, offer the electrician an acceptable level ofprotection that is recognized by the electricalindustry. The use of fused leadsprovides additional protectionfor the worker. Why use overvoltage category rated multimeters? Momentary high-voltage transients or spikes can travelthrough a multimeter at any timeand without warning. Motors,capacitors, lightning, and powerconversion equipment such asvariable speed drives are allpossible sources of spikes.The IEC 1010 standard defines categories I throughIV that are abbreviated as CAT I, CAT II, CAT III,etc. The higher-numbered categories represent anelectrical environment that is susceptible to higher-energy spikes. For example, multimeters that aredesigned to the CAT IV standard provide theworker more protection from high transient voltagespikes than do CAT III, CAT II, or CAT I designs.See the diagram on the next page and Table 3below for an explanation of each category. Be sure that the multimeter model has been tested. Simply being designed to the CAT IIIstandard, for example, does not mean themultimeter was also tested to that standard. Look for proof of independent testing byan organization accredited by theStandards Council of Canada, suchas the CSA (Canadian StandardsAssociation) International logo,along with the appropriatecategory rating on the equipment.

    "content": "26 – 12ELECTRICAL HAZARDS leads should also be rated at the same or greater voltage than the multimeter. Understanding overvoltage installation categories The division of a power distribution system into catagories is based on the fact that a dangeroushigh-energy transient such as a lightning strikewill be attenuated or dampened as it travelsthrough the impedance (AC resistance) of thesystem. A higher CAT number refers to anelectrical environment with higher poweravailable and higher-energy transients.Therefore, a multimeter designed to the CAT IIIstandard is resistant to much higher-energytransients than one designed to the CAT IIstandard. Categories I through IV apply to low voltage (less than 1000 V) test equipment. Safe use of multimeters • Use only multimeters that display both the CSA logo (or equivalent) andthe CAT (I, II, III, or IV) designation. Categories I through IV apply to low voltage (less than1000 V) test equipment. • Check to ensure that the meter’s voltage rating is appropriate for the work beingdone. Be aware of multimeters with maximum voltage ratings typical of othercountries (550 V for example). • Use personal protective equipment such as arc flash fire-resistant clothing; eye andface protection; long sleeve shirts;dielectric safety boots; rubber gloves withleather protectors; and mats, blankets, orshields as required. Do not wear synthetic inner or outer clothing thatcan melt if an arc flash occurs. • Check the manufacturer’s manual for special cautions. Moisture and cold mayaffect the performance of your meter. • Wipe the multimeter and test leads clean to remove any surface contamination priorto use. • Use fused test leads. Ensure fused leads and internal probe fuses are rated as highas or higher than the equipment you aregoing to work on. A minimum of 30 kA isrecommended (200 kA is desirable). • Ensure that test leads are in the correct input jacks. • When the values to be measured are uncertain, start testing with high ranges ofthe multimeter, then move to the lowerranges. • Connect to the ground first, and disconnect from ground last. • Test the multimeter on a known power source to verify that the meter isfunctioning properly before and aftertesting the suspect circuit, using the samepower function for all three tests. Using a meter to confirm zero energyfor a lockout Set the meter to the power function to be usedfor validating the zero energy. Test to ensurethe meter is functioning correctly by testing ona known power source, then test the lockedout circuit to verify the power has beeneffectively isolated, and finally re-test on thesame known power supply to verify themeter’s fuse has not blown and the meter isstill functioning correctly on that power setting.",

A grounding conductor limits the voltage or current to the ground during normal operation,and also prevents excessive voltages due tolightning strikes. A temporary ground provides a direct physical connection to the mass of the earth. Temporarygrounding typically involves the use of a wire orcable that has one end connected to a de-energized circuit, and the other end to a knowngrounded connection.

Lockout and tagging ensures that hazardous energy sources are under the control of each worker. Serious orfatal accidents can occur when people assume thatmachinery is turned off or made harmless— but it isn’t . Lockout is a procedure that prevents the release of hazardous energy. It often involves workers using a padlock to keep a switch in the “off” position, or to isolate the energy of moving parts. This prevents electric shock,sudden movement of components, chemical combustion,falling counterweights, and other actions that canendanger lives. Lockout is a physical way to ensure thatthe energy source is de-energized, deactivated, orotherwise inoperable. Tagging tells others that the device is locked out, who has locked it out, and why. Tagged devices and systems must not be re-energized without the authority of thosenamed on the tag. FORMS OF ENERGY When most people think of uncontrolled hazardousenergy, they think of electricity. But construction crewsdoing work in industrial or office settings often have tolock out and tag a variety of energy sources. Here are themain types. •Electrical—electrical panels, generators, lighting systems, etc. •Mechanical (the energy of moving parts)—flywheels, blades, fans, conveyor belts, etc. •Potential (stored energy that can be released during work)—suspended loads, compressed air, electrical capacitors, accumulated bulk goods, coiled springs, chemical reactions, changing states (solid—liquid—gas), etc. •Hydraulic —presses, rams, cylinders, cranes, forklifts, •Pneumatic—lines, compression tanks, tools, etc. •Thermal—steam, hot water, fire, etc. •Chemical—flammable materials, corrosive substances, vapours, etc. Some equipment may involve more than one type of energy, and pose unexpected hazards. For example, a machine may have an electrically operated componentwith a hydraulic or pneumatic primary power source, or it may become activated on a timed schedule. With someequipment, gravity and momentum can presentunexpected hazards. Y ou must recognize and control conditions such as these. Switches, power sources, controls, interlocks, pneumatics,hydraulics, computer-controlled sources, gravity-operatedsources—all of these must be locked out andappropriately tagged by each worker involved. Many plants or industrial establishments will have specificprocedures for lockout and tagging. This makes sensebecause the in-plant workforce will have proven itsprocedures through use on the particular system ormachine in question. Follow these procedures, but also verify that all energy sources have been isolated because construction workmay differ from routine plant maintenance. Plant personnel may shut down machines, equipment, or processes. In other cases, plant representatives mayissue permits: 1) a work permit to allow work on theirequipment and 2) a lockout permit to ensure that alllockout procedures are followed before work begins. A written safe work procedure for lockout and tagging is essential. Once implemented and followed, a goodprocedure ensures that no form of energy can harmanyone during a lockout. A written procedure helps to ensure that lockout and tagging have been thoroughly and effectively carried outbefore work begins. It should include • training requirements for workers and supervisors • quality, type, and colour of locks, scissors, chains, blanks, blinds, and other lockout devices • method of identifying lock owners• control of keys for locks• colour, shape, size, and material for tags• method of securing tags and information to be • communication and authorization procedure for shutting down and starting up machinery and • record-keeping requirements • itemized steps to meet lockout objectives. LOCKOUT AND TAGGING Know the law Section 190 of the Construction Regulation (O. Reg. 213/91) lists the requirements for lockout and tagging,including the requirement that “written procedures for compliance with this section shall be established and implemented.”.",

    "content": "27 – 3EXPLANATION OF STEPS STEP 1: LOCATE WORK AREA AND IDENTIFY EQUIPMENT, MACHINERY, OR OTHER SYSTEMCOMPONENTS TO BE WORKED ON Identify the area with references such as floor, room name, elevation, or column number. Identify theequipment that is the subject of the work. STEP 2: IDENTIFY ALL ENERGY SOURCES Identify all energy sources affecting the equipment or machinery. Identify the various energy forms to be lockedout such as electrical, momentum, pneumatic, hydraulic,steam, and gravity. STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE PARTS TO BE LOCKED OUT OR ISOLATED Identify systems that affect, or are affected by, the work being performed. These may include primary, secondary,backup, or emergency systems and interlocked remoteequipment. Review the current system drawings for remote energy sources and, where required, identify and confirm with theclient or owner the existence and location of any switches,power sources, controls, interlocks, or other devicesnecessary to isolate the system. Remember that equipment may also be affected by • time restrictions for completing the work • time-activated devices. STEP 4: DETERMINE LOCKOUT METHODS Confirm that the lockout of all energy sources is possible. Some equipment may have to be kept operational to maintain service to other equipment that cannot be shutdown. Take appropriate steps to provide protection forworkers while working near operating equipment. Equipment that can be locked out should be locked out by the methods most appropriate to the hazards. STEP 5: NOTIFY ALL PERSONNEL AFFECTED Shutting down equipment may affect operations in other locations, incoming shifts, or other trades who may beplanning to operate the locked-out system. Beforeproceeding with the lockout, inform all personnel who willbe affected. At construction sites with a large workforce or at relatively large factories, you may need to have specialcommunication methods and permits or approvals.STEP 6: SHUT DOWN EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY Qualified personnel must shut down the equipment, machinery, or other system components, placing them ina zero-energy state. Trace all systems to locate and lockout energy sources. The main source may be electrical,for instance, but pneumatic and other forms of energymay also be present. Always look for other possibleenergy sources. All equipment capable of being energized or activated electrically, pneumatically, or hydraulically must be de-energized or de-activated by physically disconnecting or otherwise making the apparatus inoperable. Always ensure that the client and operators are aware of the plan to shut down and lock out equipment, machinery,or other system components. In some cases, operationspersonnel or equipment operators may be required to shutdown components because of their special qualificationsor knowledge of the system. In determining what needs to be shut down and locked out, consider the different energy sources that may befound in the system. STEP 7: INSTALL LOCKOUT DEVICES After the circuit has been de-energized and locked out by the person in charge, each worker involved in thelockout must be protected by placing his or herpersonal lock on the isolating device. Remember —even though the disconnect is already locked out, you are not protected until you attach your ownpersonal safety lock. Each worker must retain his or her key while the lock is in place. Only the worker in charge of the lock should have akey. Remember . . . • Merely removing a fuse doesn’t constitute lockout. The fuse could be easily replaced. The fuse should be removed and the box locked out. • The lockout devices attached to one system should not prevent access to the controls and energy-isolating devices of another system. Locks should be high-quality pin-type, key-operated, and numbered to identifyusers. Multiple locks and lockout bars When several workers or trades are working on a machine, you can add additional locks by using a lockoutbar. Y ou can add any number of locks by inserting anotherlockout bar into the last hole of the previous bar.LOCKOUT AND TAGGING In-plant procedures specified by the owner or clienttake precedence over the procedures outlined here,provided there is no contravention of existing codes orlaws.",

    "content": "27 – 4Other lockout devices Scissors—have holes for locks and should be made of hardened steel. Chains—should be high quality and snug Blocks or cribbing —prevent or restrict movement of parts. Blanks or blinds —are solid metal plates inserted at flanged connections to preventthe flow of liquids or gases. Pins and clamps—should be of high-quality materials anddesigned to fit the system. STEP 8: TAGGING Section 190 of the Construction Regulation (O. Reg. 213/91) requires each worker involved in a lockoutoperation to attach a durable tag to his or her personallock. The tag must identify the worker’s name, theworker’s employer, the date and time of lockout, the workarea involved, and the reason for the lockout. A tag in itself offers no guarantee that a machine or system is locked out. It simply provides information. Signs must be placed on the system indicating that • it must not be energized or operated • guards, locks, temporary ground cables, chains, tags, and other safeguards must not be tampered with or removed until a) the work is complete, and b) each worker has removed his or her personal A record must be kept of all equipment locked out or otherwise rendered inoperable so that all of these devicescan be reactivated once the work is complete.STEP 9: VERIFY ZERO-ENERGY STATE After any power or product remaining in the equipment has been discharged or disconnected by qualifiedpersonnel, verify that all personnel are clear of theequipment. Then try, with extreme caution, to start theequipment manually. Look for any movement or functions.If none are observed, confirm that all energy sources areat a zero-energy state. Test the system to ensure that all electrical components are de-energized and de-activated, including interlockingand dependent systems that could feed into the system,either mechanically or electrically. STEP 10: PERFORM THE TASK Carry out and complete the work assignment. STEP 11: COMMUNICATE THAT WORK IS COMPLETE AND THAT ALL PERSONNEL ARE CLEAR • Ensure that personnel are clear of the locked-out equipment, machinery, or system. • Remove only your tags and locks. • Tell personnel that were originally informed of the lockout that the equipment, machinery, or system is no longer locked out. STEP 12: RESTORE POWER Return systems to operational status and the switches to power ON. Have qualified personnel restart machinery orequipment. STEP 13: RETURN CONTROL TO OPERATING When all work is completed, the person in charge of the lockout operation should formally return control of theequipment or system to plant personnel. STEP 14: RECORD DATE/TIME LOCKOUT REMOVED AND SYSTEM RESTORED This last step is important. It saves valuable information that may be lost if not recorded. Staff involved in theshutdown may not remain at the same jobsite. Owners oroperators may require this information to help plan futureshutdowns. Lockout can ensure the safety of a single mechanic working alone or of hundreds of workers in a factory. Ineither situation, a procedure for safe lockout and taggingmust be written, implemented, and followed step by step. Lockout and tagging procedures help to ensure that • all energy sources are identified and locked out • energy is not inadvertently restored while work is proceeding • maintenance, repair, installation, and other jobs can be carried out safely • records are kept.

Overhead powerlines When equipment operates within reach of (and could therefore encroach on) the minimumpermitted distance from a live overhead powerline,the constructor must have written procedures inplace to prevent the equipment from encroachingon the minimum distance. If equipment touches a high-voltage line, the operator should take the followingprecautions. 1)Stay on the machine. Don’t touch equipment and ground at same time.Touching anything in contact with theground could be fatal. 2)Anyone operating accessory equipment should also remain on that equipment.They should also avoid making contactwith the ground and the equipment at thesame time.Voltage Rating of Powerline Minimum Distance 750 or more volts, but not 3 metres (10') more than 150,000 volts more than 150,000 but 4.5 metres (15') not more than 250,000 volts more than 250,000 volts 6 metres (20') Keep people away from machine if there is a powerline contact. Stay on the machine unless there is an emergency such as fire.",

Warn them not to touch the load, load lines, boom, bucket, or any other part of the equipment (Figure 26). 4)Get someone to call the local utility to shut off power. 5)If possible, the operator (while remaining on the machine) can try to break contactby moving the machine clear of the wires. Warning: Beware of time relays. Evenafter breakers are tripped by linedamage, relays may be triggered torestore power. 6)If the operator can’t break contact by moving the machine (while remaining onit), do not move the machine until theutility shuts down the line and confirmsthat power is off. 7)If an emergency such as fire forces you to leave the machine, jump clear (Figure 27).Never step down. If part of your bodycontacts the ground while another parttouches the machine, current will travelthrough you.8)Jump with feet together and shuffle away in small steps. Don’t take big steps. Withvoltage differential across the ground, onefoot may be in a higher voltage area thanthe other. The difference can kill you(Figure 28). Special precautions are required for casualties incontact with live powerlines or equipment. 1)Never touch the casualty or anything in contact with the casualty. 2)If possible, break contact. Use a dry board, rubber hose, or dry polypropylene rope tomove either the casualty or the line. Anobject can sometimes be thrown toseparate the casualty from the wire. Warning : Touching the casualty, even with dry wood or rubber, can bedangerous. With high voltage lines,objects that are normally insulatorscan become conductors. 3)Call emergency services — in most cases ambulance, fire department, and utility. Voltage differential across the ground caninjure or kill you. If an emergency forces you to leave the machine, jump clear with feet together and shuffle away — never step down.",

    "content": "32 – 4Welding and Cutting In recent years, propane has become a popular energy source in open flame welding and cutting. Combined withoxygen in a manner similar to oxyacetylene welding, itprovides a gas mix that is considered much more stable bymany users. While welding cylinders are generally smaller than cylinders used for construction heaters, they should be treated withthe same care. • Fittings should be clean and free of grease before hooking • Fitting wrenches should be used to avoid damage toparts. • Cylinders should be in an upright position at all times,kept in a suitable cradle whenin use, and preferably tiedupright to prevent tipping over(Figure 9). • A fire extinguisher (4A40BC minimum) should be keptclose when using any torch. • Regulators should be removed and stored in aprotective case when not in use, along with hoses andtorches. • Consult manufacturer's handbook for oxypropane regulator settings. They are very different fromoxyacetylene settings. For more information, refer to Welding and Cutting in this manual.Summary The safe use of propane depends on twelve basic rules: 1) Don't store cylinders inside a building. 2) Remove cylinders from the building when not in use or when empty. 3) Keep cylinders away from heat sources, and flammables away from heaters. 4) Always secure cylinders to prevent upset.5) Never transport cylinders in an enclosed vehicle or 6) Always use proper gear for hoisting or moving cylinders around the worksite. 7) Keep heaters in good condition. Repairs and maintenance should be done only by licensed service personnel. 8) Always have a fire extinguisher handy (4A40BC 9) Protect stored cylinders or bulk tanks from on-site 10) Don't tamper with controls or safety devices. 11) Never enter an area where leaking gas is suspected.12) Don't use or store cylinders of propane in low areas such as trenches, maintenance holes, or basements.PROPANE Oxypropane Welding Cart.",

Someone who is competent in respiratorselection must determine the appropriate type ofrespirator. Workers required to wear respirators must be instructed how to properly fit and maintain them. For moreinformation on respiratory protection, refer to the chapteron Respiratory Protection in this manual, or the CanadianStandards Association’s standard Z94.4-02, Selection, Use, and Care of Respirators . 6) ISOLATION OF ENERGY ANDCONTROL OF MATERIAL MOVEMENT Equipment that moves in any way (even rotation) must beisolated by ❑disconnecting the equipment from its power source and de-energizing the equipment, or ❑lockout and tagging. Only workers trained in lockoutand tagging should perform such operations. Lockout and tagging should be done even if you use the first option (disconnect and de-energize) to isolate theenergy.For pneumatic or hydraulic equipment, isolate the power source and depressurize the supply lines. Depressurizeany components that may still be pressurized after thesupply lines have been bled-hydraulic cylinders forexample. Y ou must disconnect and drain pipes carryingsolids or liquids to or from a confined space, or insertblank flanges. If the pipe cannot be blanked off or disconnected, the valve may be closed, chained, locked and tagged,provided thatthis type ofcontrol—and itsimportance—have beenexplained to allworkers in thearea. Simply closing valvesis notgenerallyacceptable. Y ou may need blocking to prevent movement caused by gravity for some equipment (e.g., conveyors). Electrical equipment in the space should bedisconnected, tagged andlocked out, and groundedwhen it's practical to do so. In the case of live electrical work in a confined space,you need to pay specialattention to standardprocedures. A minormistake in a manhole canlead to disaster. Cramped working conditions can makeaccidental contact with anenergized conductor morelikely, so you may need non-conductive equipment. Y ou may need gloves, mats, and other insulating equipment depending upon the type of work. Capacitorsor other components which can store a charge should bedischarged and/or grounded.CONFINED SPACES Do not use single-strap dust masks and surgical masks—they are not approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH is a U.S.-based organization thatapproves respirators. Workers must be supplied withNIOSH-approved respirators only. All NIOSH- approved respirators have an approval number (always starting with the letters TC) on them. Make sure your respirator has all the proper parts. Since each manufacturer uses different designs,parts are not interchangeable between brands. Make sure you use the correct parts (cartridges, aircylinders, etc.) for your brand of respirator. Never use cartridges or air cylinders from another manufacturer. They will not fit correctly and will endanger the life of the worker or rescuer.",

    "content": "33 – 14If measurements are within acceptable exposure limits but are approaching hazardous levels, the competent worker'sdecision to proceed should be based on an assessmentof the source of the problem, the likelihood of change, andthe conditions at the scene. In doubtful cases, it is best toimplement the appropriate controls discussed in thefollowing section. Recording the results. The test results must be recorded on the work entry permit. The records must be kept by the constructor oremployer for at least one year after the project is finished. 10) COMBUSTIBLE, EXPLOSIVE, ORFLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERES No worker is allowed to enter a confined space if airbornecombustible dust or mist is present in a concentration sufficient for explosion. If an explosive or flammable atmosphere is detected, you can perform only certaintypes of work. The conditions for each type of work arespecified below the following definitions. a)Between 0% and 5% of the LEL, you can perform hot work. The following conditions must also be met: ❑The oxygen content must be maintained below ❑The atmosphere must be continuoouslymonitored. ❑The entry permit must include adequateprovisions for hot work, and it must specify the appropriate measures to be taken. ❑An alarm and exit procedure must be in place to provide adequate warning and allow safe escape if the atmospheric concentration exceeds 5% ofthe LEL or if the oxygen content exceeds 23%. b)Between 0% and 10% of the LEL, you can perform cold work. c)Between 0% and 25% of the LEL, you can performinspection work. Alternatively, work may be carried out in the confined space if the combustible, explosive or flammableatmosphere is rendered inert by an inert gas (such asnitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide). The atmosphere must be monitored continuously to ensure it remains inert. The worker in the confined spacemust use adequate respiratory equipment as well asadequate equipment to help people outside the confinedspace locate and rescue the worker if a problem occurs.CONFINED SPACES Acceptable atmospheric levels Explosive orflammable gasor vapour< 25% of its lower explosive limit:inspection work can be performed. < 10% of its lower explosive limit: cold work can be performed. (Cold work is work which does not involve – welding and cutting – the use of tools or equipment which can produce a spark – other sources of ignition.) < 5% of its lower explosive limit: hot work can be performed. Oxygen contentAt least 19.5% but not more than23% by volume. Exposure toatmosphericcontaminantsExposures to atmosphericcontaminants must not exceed whatis reasonable in the circumstances(section 221.2 (c) of theConstruction Regulation). The exposure limits in the regulation on Control of Exposureto Biological or Chemical Agents(Ontario Regulation 833) and theDesignated Substance Regulations*are generally consideredreasonable for protecting workers. * This is the case despite the fact that construction projects are, strictly speaking, exempt from Regulation 833 and most of the Designated Substance Regulations. (The Designated Substance Regulation which does apply to construction is O. Reg. 278/05: Designated Substance–Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations.) ★Never trust your senses to determine whether the atmosphere in a confined space is safe. ★Y ou cannot see or smell many toxic gases andvapours. ★Y ou cannot determine by your senses the levelof oxygen present. ★Know which gases or vapours may be present inthe confined space and test for them.Inerting is the process of replacing the potentially combustible atmosphere in a confined space with a noncombustible gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium,or carbon dioxide. Hot work means activities that could produce a source of ignition such as a spark or open flame.Examples of hot work include welding, cutting,grinding, and using non-explosion-proof electricalequipment. Cold work means activities that cannot produce a source of ignition.",

    "content": "33 – 1511. VENTILATION/PURGING This is the most effective method of control. The space can be purged of dangerous atmospheres by blowingenough fresh air in, and/or by removing (or suction-venting) the bad air and allowing clean air in. Studies haveshown that the best results are obtained by blowing freshair into a space close to the bottom. Check the efficiencyof ventilation by re-testing the atmosphere with the gasdetection equipment before entry. When ventilation is used to improve the air in a confined space, ensure that the toxic or flammable gases orvapours removed from the space do not pose a risk toother workers. “Exhaust air” should not be discharged intoanother work area. In cases where the concentration of explosive gas or vapouris higher than the UEL,ventilation will bring theconcentration down intothe “Explosive Range.”This is one reason whyyou should use only“explosion-proof” fans.These may be speciallydesigned fans poweredby electricity orcompressed air. Somepneumatic air moversmay also be suitable. For manholes, you can use portable fans. Theseusually provide around750-1,000 cubic feet ofair per minute.A typical manhole 10 feet deep and 5 feet wide contains196 cubic feet. Blowing in 750 cubic feet per minuteshould provide an air change every 15 seconds and easilydilute or displace most dangerous atmospheres. Fans capable of moving 5,000 cubic feet per minute are available for use in larger tanks and vessels. This type of ventilation may not be adequate in situations where additional toxic or explosive gases or vapours maybe generated (e.g., during cleaning and resurfacing tanksor by disturbing sludge and scale). In the case of welding or other work which generates a localized source of toxic gas, fume, or vapour, an exhaustventilator can be used to draw out and discharge thehazard in an open area. (See figure below.) Options must be evaluated by someone who understands the risks of the work being done. CONFINED SPACES The inert gas will replace all of the oxygen as well as the combustible gases in the confined space.Workers entering the confined space should useNIOSH-approved air-supplied respirators. After work is completed, the confined space must beproperly ventilated, and a competent worker musttest the confined space to see if it is safe. If you use mechanical ventilation to maintainacceptable atmospheric levels by providing acontinuous supply of fresh air, you must have awarning system (i.e., an alarm) and exit procedure incase there is a ventilation failure. The alarm shouldbe activated by a pressure switch at the fan rather than by electrical failure. This ensures that the alarmis activated if the fan belt fails.",
