    "content": "Legal Requirements 2-12 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES An emergency is an unplanned event that has the potential to harm the life, health, or safety of a person, or to damage the environment or public property. Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Every construction project needs an emergency response plan before work begins so that everyone is prepared in case of an emergency. Section 17 of the Construction Projects regulation (213/91) states: 17. (1) A constructor shall establish for a project written procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency and shall ensure that the procedures are followed at the project. (2) The constructor shall review the emergency procedures with the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative for the project, if any. (3) The constructor shall ensure that the emergency procedures are posted in a conspicuous place at the project. Because the size and complexity of a project differs from site to site, the planning necessary for emergencies will also differ. An effective plan must take into consideration the items listed below. 1. Assessment/Hazard Identification Identify hazards and assess potential risk by answering these questions: • What can go wrong? • What are the consequences? 2. Emergency Resources Determine what resources are available for the hazards identified and assessed. Verify that 911 operates in area. If not, make alternate arrangements. Maintain on-site resources such as fire extinguishers, spills containment equipment, and first aid kits. Outside help may be so far away that on-site resources are necessary, such as fire protection or ambulance and medical resources in remote areas.3. Communication Systems To relay accurate information quickly, use reliable communications equipment, develop procedures, and train personnel. A backup system is a good idea in case the emergency destroys phone lines, for example. The type and location of emergency communication systems must be posted on the project. Emergency phone numbers and the site address/location should be posted beside all site phones. IHSA’s Emergency Response Poster (P103) can be used to record this and other information (Figure 2-1). 4. Administration of the Plan The person in charge of administering and organizing the plan must ensure the following: • Everyone clearly understands their roles and responsibilities within the plan. • Adequate emergency resources are available for each stage of the project. • The plan is reviewed regularly and always after an emergency to correct any shortcomings. 5. Emergency Response Procedures Before you begin work on a jobsite, make sure you are familiar with the emergency response procedures for that site. The Emergency Procedures chart (Figure 2-2) outlines standard emergency response procedures. STOP and ASSESS the situation before performing any of the tasks. Stay calm to provide an example to others. The site supervisor should be able to provide information about: • Emergency warning alarms and codes • Emergency telephone numbers • Nearest hospital • Rescue procedures • Meeting or muster points • Names of persons capable of administering • Location of emergency equipment such as fire extinguishers.

    "content": "Construction Health and Safety ManualEMERGENCY PROCEDURES Emergency Procedures DO NOT PANIC. Your behaviour can influence others so staying calm will help the emergency TAKE COMMAND Call—or delegate someone to call— emergency services (911) immediately and explain the situation. Assign someone to meet and direct the ambulance to the location. ASSESS THE SITUATION Use extreme caution when approaching the scene to avoid being injured yourself. Try to determine what happened and what the emergency is. Try to eliminate or control the cause of the emergency to prevent further danger to the injured worker, to others, or to the property. Give first aid as soon as PROVIDE PROTECTION Safeguard the area to protect others from being injured and prevent further losses. You may be called upon to help divert traffic, suppress a fire, prevent objects from falling, or shut down equipment or utilities. PRESERVE THE SCENE Do not disturb anything except to save a life, relieve suffering, or prevent immediate or further losses. Barricade, rope off, or post a guard at the scene to make sure that nothing is moved until the authorities have completed their investigation . FOLLOW PROCEDURES Follow the procedures outlined in your company’s emergency response plan. Ensure that senior management is informed. They can contact the proper authorities, notify relatives, and begin the procedures for reporting and investigating the incident . Figure 2-2: Emergency Procedures6. Communication of the Procedures • Review the procedures with workers, subcontractors, and suppliers to ensure that it covers their activities. • Review it with owner/client in operating plants to ensure that hazards are identified and covered. • Review it regularly with JHSC or Health and Safety Representative to address new hazards or significant changes in site conditions. • Post the procedures in a conspicuous location at the project (Figure 2-3) . When developing your plan, make sure it always reflects current conditions on the jobsite. For more detailed information on developing emergency response plans, refer to the Emergency Response Planning booklet (B030) available from IHSA and the Emergency Response Planning Checklist at the end of this chapter. For additional resources, visit the Emergency Preparedness web page in the Policy and Program Templates section of the ihsa.ca website: ihsa.ca/resources/emergency_preparedness.aspx Remember: Calling 911 by itself is not an emergency response plan. A plan should involve reducing the risk of further injuries and taking into consideration such things as: • Proper access for emergency responders and • The need to move a worker, if necessary, to a place where they can be attended to by emergency responders • Designating a person to be in charge of the situation during an emergency.

Using a steel basket stretcher A steel basket (i.e., litter) stretcher is designed to be used where there are obstacles to moving a person in need of rescue. The injured worker lies in the stretcher face up and is strapped in to prevent them from falling out or There is typically a collar around the stretcher that protects the injured person against bumping into objects. An injured worker should be moved only after speaking with emergency rescue personnel (e.g., 911). Other Considerations Before starting any rescue from heights, the employer and contactors must contact the local Fire Department to find out the following: • What type of support can be expected from a local Fire Department? • What support limitations may exist with Local Fire Departments? • What contingencies should the contractor/ employer may establish if a local fire department cannot respond (either other response requirements or due to support limitations)? • What emergency response equipment would a local fire department want the contractor/ employer to have on site? • If a local Fire Department rescue teams will only use equipment they supply, analyze what support gaps may exist and how the employer/contractor can help to fill these gaps.Figure 2-5: A Steel Basket (Litter) Stretcher Can Be Used to Rescue an Injured WorkerIn addition to contacting the local Fire Department, all rescue procedures should also address the following issues: • The need for rescue in good time • Working alone issues and procedures • Communication requirements • How often the changing site conditions will require revisions to the emergency plan • The safety of the persons carrying out or assisting with the rescue • The best way for rescuers to get access to the • Any first aider on site who can provide the medical needs that the casualty may have due to their injury or the effects of suspension trauma • The anchor points to be used for any rescue • The suitability of using the fall arrest equipment that has already been deployed (e.g., anchors, harnesses, attachments and connectors) during the rescue procedure • Showing rescuers the actual anchor points on the site crane(s) and familiarizing them with the rescue techniques to be used on these cranes • The method that will be used to attach the casualty to the recovery system • The direction that the casualty needs to be moved to get them to the point of safety (i.e., raising, lowering, or moving them laterally) • The potential for a casualty to be located over an edge and other possible obstructions that can NOTE: Recovery over an edge can interfere with the operation of rescue equipment and can also increase the risk of equipment such as ropes, slings and harnesses being cut or abraded.

    "content": "The Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours in its international and national capacity to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, co-operation, and lasting peace amongst all peoples. Impartiality It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class, or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress. Neutrality In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious, or ideological nature. Independence The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.Voluntary Service It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain. There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory. Universality The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide. The Fundamental Principles were proclaimed by the XXth International Conference of the Red Cross, Vienna, 1965. This is the revised text contained in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement, adopted by the XXVth International Conference of the Red Cross, Geneva, 1986. In keeping with the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, the Society is committed to Social Justice in the elimination of Society structures and actions that oppress, exclude, limit, or discriminate on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, financial ability, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or age.",

    "content": "Our History In June of 1859, Henry Dunant saw an unforgettable scene: 40,000 dead and wounded soldiers left on the field after the Battle of Solferino in Italy. Dunant organized local villagers into first aid teams to help as many of the wounded as possible, saving thousands of lives. To prevent this horror from happening again, Dunant decided to create a neutral organization to care for wounded soldiers and prisoners—an organization that would be respected and protected by both sides in any conflict. The result was the Red Cross. Dunant spent the rest of his life trying to reduce the suffering caused by war. He lobbied governments, organized Red Cross Societies in different countries, and spoke to the public. In the spring of 1885, during Louis Riel’s Northwest Rebellion, Dr. George Sterling Ryerson stitched a Red Cross made of cotton onto white material and used this as a flag to distinguish the horse drawn wagon being used to transport the wounded. This was one of the first Red Cross flags ever flown in Canada. In 1896, Dr. Ryerson founded the first overseas branch of the British Red Cross, which later became the Canadian Red Cross. In 1901, Dunant won the first Nobel Peace Prize. By founding what is now the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, he has saved the lives of millions of people.On May 19, 1909, The Canadian Red Cross Society Act was approved by Parliament, and decreed that the Canadian Red Cross would serve as an auxiliary to the Government of Canada for Canadians, which was a measure that was in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. (Prior to 1909, the Canadian Red Cross operated as a branch of the British Red Cross.) As a result, for more than a century, Canadians have had their own national Red Cross Society dedicated to improving the situations of the most vulnerable people in Canada and around the world. Today, there are Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies in more than 190 countries, all dedicated to the same ideals and fundamental principles. The Fundamental Principles In every country, our programs and activities are guided by seven Fundamental Principles. The Tanzanian Red Cross has created a short, simple version of these principles: Humanity: We serve people, but not systems. Impartiality: We care for the victims and the aggressors alike. Neutrality: We take initiatives, but never take sides. Independence: We bow to needs, but not rulers. Voluntary Service: We work around the clock, but never for personal gain. Unity: We have many talents, but a single idea. Universality: We respect nations, but our work knows no bounds. Essentially, we provide help to people in need, whatever their race, gender, culture, ethnicity, financial ability, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or age. The Red Cross.",

    "content": "Red Cross Symbols The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has three official symbols: the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal. All three symbols are equivalent and share the same status under international law. Each national society of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement chooses one of these three symbols to use in their country. The three emblems are used to identify military medical services as well as the people, programs, and objects connected with the activities of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Recognized as a symbol of humanity and neutrality, the emblem is the only protection Red Cross workers have when they bring relief and protection to victims of armed conflicts. The emblem identifies and protects the sick, the wounded and those who come to their aid, and medical equipment, buildings, and vehicles.The Red Crescent Although the Red Cross emblem has no religious, political, or cultural associations, it was sometimes believed to be related to the Christian cross, and this association was problematic in certain regions and conflicts. In 1929, the International Federation of the Red Cross agreed to the adoption of an additional, equivalent emblem: The Red Crescent. This emblem could be used by any national society in place of the Red Cross. The Red Crystal In December of 2005, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement welcomed the decision to create an additional emblem alongside the Red Cross and Red Crescent: the Red Crystal. The Red Cross The Red Cross symbol—five red, equal-sized squares forming a cross resting on a white background— was adopted in 1863 at the first International Conference of what would one day be the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society. Today it is one of the most recognized emblems in the world, and continues to be an internationally respected symbol of protection and neutrality. The Red Cross is the emblem that is used by the Canadian National Society. No organization—except the Canadian Red Cross and the medical services of the armed forces—has the right to use the Red Cross emblem in Canada. The Red Cross emblem must be readily recognized and respected around the world as a trusted symbol of protection and humanitarian aid. Its use is legislated by the Geneva Conventions Act, the Trade Marks Act, and the Canadian Red Cross Society Act. The Red Cross.",

    "content": "Preparing For Emergencies at Home To be ready for an emergency at home: •Keep important information about yourself and your family in a handy place. Include your address, everyone’s date of birth, health card numbers, medical conditions, allergies, and prescriptions and dosages. List the names and phone numbers of your doctors. •Post the numbers for the police, fire department, emergency medical services (EMS), and Poison Control Centre near every phone in your home and save these numbers in your mobile phone’s contacts list. •Teach children how to call for help. •Install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Test them regularly. •Keep first aid kits handy in your home and car. Make sure everyone in the family knows where they are and what is in them. •Review and practice the first aid skills that you learn so that you will have the confidence and knowledge to respond in an emergency. Most communities are served by the emergency telephone number 9-1-1. If your community does not operate on a 9-1-1 system, search online or in your local phone directory for the numbers of the police department, fire department, and EMS system. Also include the number for your provincial or territorial Poison Control Centre’s hotline on your list. Teach everyone in your home how and when to use these numbers. Take steps to make it easier for EMS personnel and others to help you, should an emergency occur: •Make sure your house or apartment number is large, easy to read, and well-lit at all times. Numerals (e.g., “87”) are easier to see and read than words (e.g., “eighty-seven”). •Keep relevant medical information, such as a list of the medications that each family member takes, in an accessible place at home and when you go out (e.g., on the refrigerator door and in your wallet or mobile phone).Mobile phones and other electronic devices can display emergency contacts. The letters \"ICE\" (for \"In Case of Emergency\") may appear in the phone’s contacts list next to the name of a doctor, spouse, or other important contact. Assigning \"ICE\" to a contact allows emergency personnel to reach someone who knows important facts about the ill or injured person. If the mobile phone has been programmed to include the ICE contact with a \"0\" in front, it will appear as the first contact in the person’s list If you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes, epilepsy, or allergies, consider wearing a medical identification product to alert EMS personnel of your condition in case you are unable to do so. There are also applications you can use to create digital identification tags in your mobile phone. These tags can be viewed even when your phone is locked, and so can provide important information in an emergency (such as your medical conditions, blood type, and emergency contact details). In a life-threatening emergency, every second counts. By preparing for emergencies, you can help ensure that care begins as soon as possible— for yourself, a family member, a co-worker, or a member of your community. Responding to Emergencies.",

    "content": "Legal Issues Around First Aid Good Samaritan Laws Good Samaritan laws, which protect First Aiders from financial liability, were developed to encourage people to help others in emergency situations. These laws assume a First Aider will do his or her best to save a life or prevent further injury. Good Samaritan laws require the First Aider to use common sense and a reasonable level of skill, as well as to give only the type of emergency care that is within his or her training. Good Samaritan laws usually protect First Aiders who act in the same manner as a \"reasonable and prudent person\" would in the same situation. For example, a reasonable and prudent person would: • Move a person only if the person’s life was in danger. • Ask a responsive person (or the parent, guardian, or caregiver of a child or baby) for permission to help (consent) before giving care. • Check a person for life-threatening conditions before giving further care. • Call EMS/9-1-1. • Continue to give care until more highly trained personnel take over. If a First Aider’s actions are grossly negligent or reckless, or if the First Aider abandons the person after starting care, Good Samaritan laws may not protect the First Aider. Workplace First Aiders First aid in the workplace can be governed by both national and provincial/territorial legislation. A workplace First Aider has additional responsibilities and may be legally required to provide first aid in the workplace if the need arises. He or she may also need to know other information, including: • Where emergency equipment is located. • How to properly complete documentation following a workplace • What the workplace-specific emergency procedures are. • How to call for help in an emergency. Refer to the legislation that governs your workplace for more information. Getting Permission to Help Once you decide to act, you need to get the ill or injured person’s permission (also known as consent) to assist. To get permission: 1. Tell the person who you are. 2. Tell the person that you are here 3. Ask the person if that is okay. You may be legally obligated to provide first aid as needed to any child or baby in your care.If a baby or a child is ill or injured: • Ask the parent, guardian, or caregiver for permission. • If the child or baby is alone, you can assume you have permission to give first aid.

When you call EMS/9-1-1, explain that you are having difficulty communicating with the person, and tell the dispatcher which language you believe the person speaks. The dispatcher may have someone available who can help with communication. Duty to Report Child Abuse or Neglect Every adult in Canada has a legal duty to report child abuse or neglect, even if it is not confirmed. Information around the specific how-to-report details can be found in your jurisdiction’s Child Protection Act, but the duty to report is uniform in all acts. If you are responding to a first aid emergency and you think a child is being harmed, then there needs to be a report to child protection and/or police. Even if you are unsure, child protection needs to be informed and needs to guide the next steps. Also share your concerns with the EMS personnel who respond to the situation. Responding to Disclosures of Violence A person revealing experiences of abuse—past or present—can be challenging and upsetting. This is even more true if the individual receiving the disclosure is close to the person and/or knows the perpetrator. Your response to the disclosure is critical. Studies show that the manner in which a disclosure of interpersonal violence is handled is a significant factor in determining the psychological impact on the victim. Indifference and blame are damaging responses that can have long- lasting consequences. The Person Is Unresponsive Or Confused, Or Has a Mental Impairment Someone who is unresponsive or confused, or who has a mental impairment, may not be able to grant permission. In these cases, the law assumes the person would give permission if he or she were able to do so. This is called implied consent. Implied consent also applies when a child or baby needs emergency medical assistance and his or her parent, guardian, or caregiver is not present. The Person Refuses Care An ill or injured person may refuse care, even if he or she desperately needs it. A parent or guardian also may refuse care for his or her child or baby. You must honour the person’s wishes. Explain to the person why you believe care is necessary, but do not touch or give care to the person, and never attempt to give the person help by force. Remember, you should never put yourself in any danger. Stay nearby, if possible, in case the person later decides to accept your help or becomes unresponsive. If you believe the person’s condition is life-threatening, call EMS/9-1- 1 and communicate that a person requires medical assistance but is refusing help. The EMS personnel who arrive will deal with the situation. If the person gives consent initially but then withdraws it, stop giving care and call EMS/9-1-1 if you have not already done so.

    "content": "If you receive a complaint of abuse, neglect, harassment, or bullying, you must know what steps need to be taken, when they need to occur, and how they need to be carried out. The complaint cannot be diminished or ignored. There must always be a response. Both verbal and non- verbal disclosures need to be handled sensitively while following specific procedures. If the disclosure is from a young person, your jurisdiction’s Child Protection Act may govern how you respond. The Emergency Medical Services System The emergency medical services (EMS) system is a network of community resources and trained personnel, organized to give emergency care in cases of injury or sudden illness. The system begins when someone sees an emergency and decides to take action by calling EMS/9-1-1. This action allows the EMS dispatcher to take down information about the emergency and provide it to the trained EMS personnel who will respond to the scene. Many EMS dispatchers are also trained to provide first aid and CPR instructions over the phone to assist the caller until EMS arrives. Chain of Survival Behaviours The Chain of Survival Behaviours is a series of steps that help ensure a positive outcome for an ill or injured person. As a First Aider, your role is to prepare, recognize emergencies, provide first aid and/or access help. Your role as a First Aider includes four basic steps: 1. Recognize the emergency. 2. Protect yourself, the ill or injured person, and bystanders. 3. Access help (e.g., call EMS/9-1-1). 4. Act according to your skills, knowledge, and comfort level. One of the simplest and most important ways of providing first aid is to call for help (EMS/9-1-1). By making this call, you ensure that the ill or injured person receives care from highly trained medical professionals.Understanding Your Role as a First Aider First aid is the immediate care that is given to an ill or injured person until more advanced care can be obtained.

    "content": "Who Is Coming to Help Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel have advanced training that allows them to provide medical care outside of the hospital setting. Depending on their level of training, EMS personnel have different roles and responsibilities. There are different kinds of trained personnel who may respond when a call is placed to EMS/9-1-1. First Responders: These include police, firefighters, and job-specific personnel such as athletic trainers and workplace first aid response teams. They are trained in time-sensitive lifesaving measures. Unlike lay responders (First Aiders), first responders have a legal obligation to act in an emergency when they are on duty. Paramedics: These are highly specialized emergency personnel whose skills include both basic and advanced life support. Once on the scene, these professionals will take over the care of the person, including transportation to a hospital or other facility if necessary.Responding to the scene of an emergency involves providing emotional support as well as caring for injuries. When providing care, you should: • Speak in a calm and reassuring manner. Ask for the ill or injured person’s name and use it often. • Communicate both verbally and nonverbally to reassure the person. • Position yourself at eye level when you talk to the ill or injured person. Avoid unnecessary physical contact and any body language that could appear threatening. • Actively listen to the ill or injured person. This involves four behaviours: 1. Making every effort to fully understand what the person is trying to say. 2. Repeating back to the person, in your own words, what the person said. 3. Avoiding criticism, anger, or rejection of the person’s statements. 4. Using open-ended questions (i.e., avoid questions that can be answered with \"Yes\" or \"No\"). Understanding Your Role in the EMS System The emergency medical services (EMS) system is a network of professionals linked together to provide the best care for people in all types of emergencies. As a member of the community, you play a major role in helping the EMS system to work effectively. Your role in the EMS system includes four basic steps: 1. Recognizing that an emergency exists 2. Deciding to help/take action 3. Activating the EMS system 4. Giving care until EMS personnel take over Responding to Emergencies.",

    "content": "EMS varies from community to community. Most people in Canada call 9-1-1 for help in emergencies, but in some areas of Canada and in many workplaces you may need to dial a different designated emergency number instead. If you live or work in an area where 9-1-1 is not the number to call in an emergency, make sure you know the designated emergency number to call. Phone carriers are required to connect any 9-1-1 call made from a mobile phone, even if the phone does not have an active service plan. In most areas, you cannot text 9-1-1. Unless you have confirmed that the 9-1-1 call centre in your area supports texting, you should always call. When to Call EMS/9-1-1 At times, you may be unsure whether EMS personnel are needed. To make the decision, use your best judgment based on the situation, your assessment of the ill or injured person, and information gained from this course and other training you may have received. Trust your instincts. When in doubt, make the call. If you think that an emergency exists, it probably does; you should call EMS/9-1-1 for professional help immediately. Call EMS/9-1-1 if there is a danger to you or others, or if the ill or injured person has any of the following conditions: • Unresponsiveness or an altered mental state (e.g., confusion) • Difficulty breathing or no signs of breathing • Persistent chest pain or pressure • Life-threatening or uncontrollable bleeding • Seizures • Severe headaches • Abnormal speech • Injuries to the head, neck, or back • Blood in the vomit or urine • An apparent mental health crisis • Imminent childbirth You should also call EMS/9-1-1 if the ill or injured person is not easily accessible, or if the situation involves any of the following: • An explosion • A motor vehicle collision • Hazardous materials • Downed electrical wires • Swift-moving water Poison Control Centres If none of the conditions above apply and you suspect that poisoning is the cause of the person’s condition, call poison control instead of EMS/9- 1-1. If any of the above conditions are true (for example, a person who may have swallowed poison is having difficulty breathing), or you are unsure of whether to call EMS/9-1-1 or poison control, call EMS/9-1-1. Activating EMS In a life-threatening emergency, it is critical that someone activate EMS by calling EMS/9-1-1. Activating EMS will send emergency medical help on its way as quickly as possible. The sooner EMS personnel arrive, the higher the chances of a positive outcome. Responding to Emergencies.",

Once you have activated EMS, call another caregiver to come and stay with any other children while you attend to the ill or injured child. If the child is being taken to the hospital, call his or her parent or guardian and ask the parent or guardian to meet you there. If you are travelling in an ambulance, tell them you will call again when you know the name and location of the hospital and that you may not know this information until after you arrive. If you cannot go with the child in the ambulance, be sure to give the paramedics the child’s medical information and your contact information. After an Emergency Being involved in an emergency and providing first aid can be stressful. After the emergency is resolved, you may have lingering feelings such as uneasiness, doubt, anxiety, and fear. After dealing with an emergency, it is often helpful to talk to somebody about the situation. Everyone reacts to stressful situations differently. It is very difficult to predict who will or will not be affected by abnormal events. Some individuals may feel better in the few days after the event. Others may find that it takes longer for their stress to go away, and that it begins to impact their relationships. Consider seeking professional help if you experience any of the following for more than two weeks after the emergency: • Crying fits or uncontrollable anger • Trouble eating • Trouble sleeping • Loss of engagement with former interests • Unusual or unexplained pain (e.g., headaches or stomach aches) • Feelings of guilt, helplessness, or hopelessness • Staying away from family and friends • Ignoring daily tasks, such as going to work For help dealing with ongoing stress symptoms, contact your local crisis intervention line. You may also speak to your family doctor or a mental health professional. Documentation If an incident occurs in a workplace (including a marine environment), it must be documented properly. The documentation may be paper and/ or electronic. The reports you create are official legal documents: paper versions should be filled out in pen (not pencil), with any changes or corrections crossed out and initialed.

    "content": "How to Prevent Diseases from Spreading Personal Precautions Personal precautions are the actions that individuals can take to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Examples include washing your hands frequently, treating all blood and other bodily fluids as infectious materials, covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, eating well, and getting enough exercise and sleep. One way to significantly reduce your risk of infection is to inspect your hands regularly and cover even small cuts with adhesive bandages. This reduces the number of points where germs can enter your body. Handwashing Proper handwashing is an important precaution for preventing the spread of germs that cause many infectious diseases. Frequent handwashing is important as part of a daily routine, for example, before eating or drinking and after using the washroom. Wearing gloves helps to protect you from infection, but it does not eliminate the need for proper hygiene. First Aiders should always wash their hands thoroughly when they have finished giving care, even if they wore gloves the entire time. Use the following guidelines when washing your hands: 1. Always use warm running water and a mild soap.2. Create a lather by rubbing your hands together with the soap—friction with the soap suds is what actually removes the germs from hands. Rub your hands together vigorously for at least 30 seconds. 3. Wash all parts of each hand. Be sure to scrub your palms and wrists, between your fingers, under your fingernails, and around the backs your hands. 4. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel.5. Turn the faucet off using the towel as a barrier between your hands and the faucet handle. Use the towel as a barrier for the door handle as well. Responding to Emergencies.",

    "content": "When to Wash Your Hands Wash your hands after touching anything that is likely to carry germs (e.g., after wiping your nose, changing a diaper, or touching a pet), and before touching anything that could carry germs into the body (e.g., before handling food or touching an open cut). It is also a good habit to wash your hands frequently, for example when returning home from a public place. In a first aid emergency, remember to wash your hands: • Before and after contact with an ill or injured person. • After handling dirty articles, instruments, or dressings. • Before or after treating wounds. • After removing gloves. Hand Sanitizers Hand sanitizers are not a substitute for hand washing, and are not suitable for cleaning visibly soiled hands. They should be used only as a temporary measure in situations where you are unable to wash your hands immediately. If you can see dirt on your hands, you should wash them with soap and water before using hand sanitizer. When using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help decontaminate your hands, use the amount of product recommended by the manufacturer. Rub it thoroughly over all the surfaces of your hands, including your nails and in between your fingers, until the product dries. Immunization Most Canadians have been immunized against common diseases such as measles and tetanus. Some vaccine-preventable diseases are serious, and can lead to disability or death. Immunizations protect not only you, but also your family, friends, and co-workers.Immunization introduces a substance into the body that builds up its resistance to germs that cause a specific disease. Some vaccinations may wear away with time. As a result, it’s possible that your immunity to a particular disease could decline. It is important to keep up with your immunization needs since protection against diseases through immunization is a lifelong process. Some vaccines require more than one injection and a certain period of time between injections. If you are planning a trip outside the country, find out well before you leave which immunizations are recommended and required in order to safely go to the countries you will be visiting. Because the risk of disease varies from place to place, this information cannot cover all the hazards that you might face. For specific guidelines on your particular situation, talk to your doctor or your community public health centre. Equipment Precautions Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the general term for items that protect you from contact with pathogens and contaminated objects. Examples include barrier devices such as safety glasses, goggles, face masks, CPR breathing barriers, and gloves. You should always use some type of barrier device between yourself and any material that could pose the risk of infection. Any disposable equipment that you have used (e.g. gloves, breathing barriers) should be immediately disposed of in a labelled leak-proof container with a biohazard symbol.

    "content": "Wearing gloves is an important way to protect yourself while giving first aid. Most gloves found in first aid kits are disposable and latex-free, as some people are allergic to latex. Disposable Proper Technique for Removing Gloves To remove soiled gloves without contaminating your skin: 1. With one hand, pinch the glove at the wrist of your second hand, being careful to touch only the glove’s outer surface. 2. Pull the glove down and off your 3. Form the glove into a ball and hold it in the palm of your gloved hand. 4. Insert your gloveless thumb under the glove of your other hand at the inner wrist. 5. Pull the glove downward off the hand, turning it inside out and trapping the other balled glove inside. 6. Discard gloves appropriately. 7. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 30 seconds, using the proper handwashing technique. gloves are meant to be worn once and then discarded; never wash or reuse disposable gloves. Gloves should fit properly. You should throw out any gloves that are discoloured, torn, or punctured. Wear gloves when: • You are providing care, especially if there is a possibility that you will come into contact with another person’s blood or other potentially infectious material. • You must handle items or surfaces soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials. When you are wearing gloves, try to limit how much you touch other surfaces. Avoid touching anything while wearing soiled gloves as pathogens can easily transfer from that surface to another person. If possible, remove soiled gloves and replace them with a clean pair before touching other surfaces or equipment in your first aid kit. Consider asking people to begin helping themselves while you retrieve and/or put on your gloves. For example, a bleeding person can use his or her own hand to apply pressure to the wound. This can also be effective in situations where gloves are not available. When you are finished providing care, remove your gloves using the proper technique to reduce the risk of contaminating your skin. Dispose of the gloves properly and wash your hands. When multiple people are in need of care, remove your gloves, wash your hands, and put on a clean pair before assisting the next person. Responding to Emergencies.",

    "content": "CPR Breathing Barriers CPR breathing barriers are used to reduce the risk of infection when giving rescue breaths by eliminating the need for mouth-to-mouth contact, protecting you from bodily fluids such as saliva and blood. The most basic and portable type of breathing barrier is a face shield—a flat piece of thin plastic that is placed over a person’s face, with an opening or valve that allows you to breathe into the person’s mouth. A pocket mask is a transparent, flexible device that creates a tight seal over the person’s nose and mouth. The opening contains a filter or a valve that protects you from coming into contact with the person’s bodily fluids and exhaled air. Breathing barriers sized specifically for children and babies are available. If possible, select equipment that is appropriately sized for the injured or ill person. Environmental Precautions Environmental precautions refer to the systems that are implemented in an area to reduce exposure to germs. Examples include making sure there is proper ventilation in the workplace, that people don’t use the same sink for hygiene and food preparation, and that any contaminated materials are immediately disposed of in a dedicated biohazard garbage. Designate a container for sharps (potentially infected sharp objects such as used needles and lancets). It should be puncture-resistant, leak-proof, and labelled with warning signs such as the biohazard symbol. To avoid infection, put all needles and similar sharp objects into this container immediately after they are used. It should not be used for other purposes.Cleaning and Disinfecting Surfaces and Equipment Reusable equipment and surfaces that have been contaminated by blood or other potentially infectious materials need to be properly cleaned and disinfected before the equipment is put back into service or the area is reopened. Clean and disinfect surfaces and equipment as soon as possible after the incident occurs. Remember to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). If blood or other potentially infectious materials have spilled onto the floor or another surface, take steps to prevent unnecessary people from accessing the area. If the spill contains sharp objects (e.g., shards of broken glass), do not pick them up with your hands. Instead, use tongs, a disposable scoop and scraper, or two pieces of cardboard to remove and dispose of them. Carefully wipe up the spill using absorbent towels, and/ or use a solidifier (a fluid-absorbing powder). After cleaning up the spill, flood the area with a freshly mixed disinfectant solution of approximately 1 part bleach to 9 parts water (a 10% solution). Always ensure that there is good ventilation, and wear gloves and eye protection when using bleach. Let the solution stand on the surface for at least 10 minutes, then use clean absorbent materials (such as paper towels) to wipe up the liquid and dry the area. Dispose of all materials used to clean up the spill in a labelled biohazard container. If a biohazard container is not available, place the soiled materials in a sealable plastic bag or a plastic container with a lid, seal the container, and dispose of it properly.Many environmental precautions are the responsibility of the employer, but you can make suggestions if you notice something that could be improved.

Hard-surfaced materials, such as dustpans, should be cleaned with a disinfectant solution. There is no need to dispose of soft materials or instruments as long as they are washed properly. Handling an Exposure Incident An exposure incident occurs when one person’s bodily fluids risk infecting another person through contact with the eyes, mucous membranes (e.g., in the mouth or nose), or an opening in the skin (e.g., a cut). Being pricked by a used syringe is also an example of an exposure incident. In the event of an exposure incident, follow these steps immediately: • Decontaminate the exposed area, if possible: ¶If your skin was exposed, wash the contaminated area with soap and water. ¶For infectious splashes into your mouth or nose, flush the area with water. ¶For infectious splashes into your eyes, irrigate the eyes with water, saline, or a sterile irrigant for 15 to 20 minutes. • Report the exposure incident to EMS personnel or your healthcare If the exposure incident occurred in a workplace setting, notify your supervisor and follow your company’s exposure control plan for reporting the incident and receiving post-exposure follow-up care.

Check the Scene Before rushing to help an ill or injured person, stop and take a good look at the scene. This will form an initial impression. Try to answer these questions: Is the scene safe for you, the ill or injured person, and any bystanders? Enter a scene only if it is safe to do so. Look for hazards such as spilled chemicals, hostile bystanders, or oncoming traffic. Listen for things such as ringing alarms or leaking gas. Smell for things such as gas or smoke. Avoid entering confined areas with poor ventilation and places where there is a risk of explosion (e.g., from leaking propane or natural gas). Do not enter the scene if the person is hostile or threatening suicide. If hazards are present, stay at a safe distance and call EMS/9-1-1. Leave dangerous situations for EMS personnel. Once EMS personnel arrive and make the scene safe, you can offer your assistance as appropriate. Remember that conditions at the scene may change, so a safe area could quickly become dangerous. It is important to continuously monitor your surroundings even if your initial assessment revealed a low level of risk. What happened? How did it happen? Take note of anything that might reveal the cause of the emergency. If the person is unresponsive and there are no witnesses, your check of the scene may offer the only clues as to what happened.

How many ill or injured people are there? Look carefully for more than one ill or injured person. A person who is moving or making noise, or who has very visible injuries, will likely attract your attention right away, but there may be a person who is silent and not moving or a person obscured by debris or wreckage who you do not notice at first. It is also easy to overlook a small child or a baby. Is there someone to help? Take note of bystanders who can be of assistance. A bystander who was there when the emergency occurred or who knows the person may be able to provide valuable information. Bystanders can also assist in other ways, such as by calling EMS/9-1-1, waiting for EMS personnel and leading them to the site of the emergency, getting needed items (such as an AED and first aid kit), controlling crowds, and reassuring the injured or ill What is your initial impression of the ill or injured person? Before you reach the person, try to form an initial impression about the person’s condition and what is wrong. For example, does the person seem alert, confused, or sleepy? Look at the person’s skin—does it appear to be its normal colour, or does it seem pale, ashen (grey), or flushed? Is the person moving or motionless? Does the person have any immediately identifiable injuries? Look for signs of a life-threatening illness or injury, such as unresponsiveness, trouble breathing, or life-threatening bleeding. Check the Person (Primary Assessment) If it is safe to do so, quickly check the person to determine his or her initial condition and whether there are any life-threatening concerns. This is called the primary assessment. 1. Check the person to see if he or she is responsive: • Does the person respond when you talk to him or her (e.g., does the person open his or her eyes, move, moan, or talk to • Does the person respond when tapped on the shoulder?

    "content": "A = Check the Airway Your first job is to make sure the person has an open airway. The airway is the pathway that connects the mouth and nose to the lungs. If it is closed or blocked, air cannot get in. The airway is most commonly blocked by the tongue. If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person’s airway is open. If the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chin-lift. The head-tilt moves the back of the tongue away from the airway, and the chin-lift opens the epiglottis. Agonal respirations originate from lower brainstem neurons as higher centres become increasingly hypoxic (oxygen- deprived) during cardiac arrest. With agonal respiration, the diaphragm is still receiving intermittent residual impulses from the brain, resulting in sporadic gasping breaths. Agonal respiration is sometimes referred to as \"air hunger\" and it can appear as snorting, gurgling, Performing the Head-Tilt/Chin-Lift To perform a head-tilt/chin-lift, place one hand on the person’s forehead and 2 or 3 fingers under the chin. Gently tilt the head back until the chin is pointing B = Check Breathing Next, check for breathing. Someone who can speak or cry is breathing. Check for normal breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. To assess breathing, put your cheek close to the person’s face so that you can hear and feel air coming out of the person’s nose and mouth while you watch the chest rising and falling. A person is breathing normally if air is moving in and out of the lungs and the chest is rising and falling in a normal, regular Agonal Respiration A person who is not breathing normally may be occasionally gasping for air: this is a reflex action called \"agonal respiration\" and unlike normal breathing, it is irregular and sporadic. Because agonal respiration does not oxygenate the blood, it is not considered normal breathing. A person who is experiencing agonal respiration is in cardiac arrest and requires immediate assistance.moaning or gasping, a gaping mouth, or laboured breathing. The duration differs from person to person, lasting from a few minutes to C = Check Circulation If the person is breathing normally (more than an occasional gasp), his or her heart is beating. Checking circulation means quickly looking at the person from head to toe for signs of life-threatening external bleeding. Life-threatening bleeding must be controlled as soon as possible. Unresponsiveness, trouble breathing, and life-threatening bleeding are all signs of a life-threatening emergency. If your initial check of the person reveals any of these conditions, you must provide care for that condition immediately.

In these cases, the person could die before EMS arrives, so providing immediate care is your highest priority. Moreover, these situations can be corrected by First Aiders, so immediate care may actually improve the person’s condition. If a person experiencing anaphylaxis is not carrying epinephrine, there is little that you can do as a First Aider, so you should call EMS/9-1-1 first before providing care. The person has life-threatening bleeding Life-threatening bleeding quickly reduces the body’s blood volume, which can be fatal. Apply direct pressure immediately, then call EMS/9-1-1 as soon as possible. In many cases, the person will be able to apply pressure to his or her own injury while you (or a bystander) call EMS/9-1-1. The person is an unresponsive child or baby who is not breathing. Children’s organs require high levels of oxygen in the blood to function efficiently and can rapidly shut down when oxygen levels are lowered. For this reason, cardiac arrest in children is more likely to be caused by low oxygen levels than by a problem with the heart itself. If you find a non-breathing child or baby who is unresponsive, you must introduce oxygen into his or her system as soon as possible. Immediately do 2 minutes of CPR (5 cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths) to increase the oxygen level, then quickly call EMS/9-1-1 before returning to provide more care.When You Call EMS/9-1-1 When you call, the EMS dispatcher who answers will likely ask: • Where is the emergency (e.g., the address, nearby intersections, or landmarks)? • What is the nature of the emergency (i.e., is police, fire, or medical assistance needed)? • What telephone number are you calling from? • What is your name? • What has happened? • How many people are involved and what is their condition? Don’t hang up until the dispatcher tells you to. The dispatcher may need more information. Many dispatchers are also trained to give first aid and CPR instructions over the phone, which can be helpful if you are unsure of what to do or need to be reminded of the proper care steps. Radio Medical Advice in a Marine Environment In a marine environment, it may not be possible for EMS personnel to come to your assistance in an emergency. You may need to contact a doctor and request advice on providing care, even if it is outside of your training. Document the doctor’s orders carefully.

When More Than One Person Is Ill or Injured If you are in a situation where there are several ill or injured people, the general principle is to provide care to the people who need it the most urgently. This involves deciding whose illness or injuries pose the greatest risks, as well as deciding who you are most able to help given your level of training. The process of sorting and providing care for multiple ill or injured people according to the severity of their conditions is called As an example, if one person has minor bleeding and another person has life-threatening bleeding, you should help the person with life- threatening bleeding first. EMS personnel will arrive before the minor bleeding becomes serious. Guidelines for Helping an Ill or Injured Person with Medication You should only help a person take his or her medication if: • It is safe to do so. • The person is responsive and has in some way expressed a need for help with finding, preparing, and/or taking the medication. When helping someone with his or her medication, check the label to ensure that it is the correct medication and, if it is a prescription medication, that it was prescribed for the person who will be taking it. You should also carefully read over any instructions or warnings (e.g., 1. Raise the person’s arm that is closest to you. 2. Place the arm farther from you across the person’s chest with the palm against the cheek. 3. Raise the knee of the leg farther from you. 4. Roll the person toward you as one unit by pulling the raised knee and supporting the head and neck with your other hand 5. Position the person on his or her side, and slide the bent knee into a position that prevents the person from rolling onto his or 6. Move the person’s other arm into a position of comfort in front of the body. 7. Reassess the person’s ABCs. The steps above are recommended, but there are other effective methods of moving a person into the recovery position. Regardless of how you do it, the important things to remember are as follows: • Support and protect the head while rolling the person. • Try to roll the person as one unit (head, back, and legs at the same time). • Roll the person into a position where the body will stay safely on • Position the head so that it keeps the airway open • Check the ABCs after you complete the roll.

If there is no name on the label, confirm with the person that it is the medication he or she wants to take. You must also ask if the person has any allergies or is taking anything that could interfere with or react negatively with the medication. Quickly review these details with the ill or injured person and obtain his or her permission before helping. Write down what medication was taken, how much of it was taken, and when it was taken. This information will be useful to EMS personnel. the case of an inhaler or auto-injector, you may have to remove the cover and follow the preparation instructions provided on the package before handing it to the person for self-administration. Guiding the Person in Taking the Medication Guiding the person in taking his or her medication also varies depending on the type of medication. For example, with tablets, this may involve telling the person to chew them or place them under the tongue. With an inhaler, this may involve instructing the person to shake the inhaler and exhale before dispensing the medication, or helping the person hold the inhaler to his or her mouth. When simply guiding the person, you do not press on the inhaler’s plunger yourself. With an auto-injector, you may guide the person by showing where on the outer thigh the epinephrine should be injected. Giving Lifesaving Medication Giving lifesaving medication involves helping an ill or injured person who has in some way expressed a need for help in taking his or her salbutamol (Ventolin) inhaler or using an epinephrine auto-injector. With an inhaler, you would dispense the correct number of sprays (from a metered-dose inhaler) either into a spacer or directly into the person’s mouth as he or she inhales. With an auto-injector, you would inject the epinephrine directly into the person’s outer thigh. Giving Ingested Medications Helping with ingested medications should be limited to finding the medication, preparing the medication, and guiding the person in taking the medication. In cases where the person is physically unable to get the medication into his or her mouth (e.g., the person has injured his or her hands), First Aiders may assist by placing the correct number of pills into the mouth or holding a liquid dispenser up to the person’s mouth, if the person has explicitly asked the First Aider to do so. Otherwise, you should never put anything into a person’s mouth, as this can be a choking hazard.Finding the Medication When helping a responsive ill or injured person find his or her medication, listen to instructions from the person on where to find it. If the person cannot speak, look in places where people typically keep their medication (e.g., backpack, purse, or pocket), or look for physical cues from the person (e.g., the person pointing at a bag). If the person cannot speak and you are helping with prescription medication, ask the person to confirm the name on the label by using physical signals (shaking or nodding the head, blinking once or twice, etc.). If the person is unable to do this, you may be able to confirm the person’s identity by asking bystanders, looking for a piece of photo ID, or checking for a medical identification product. Preparing the Medication Preparing the person’s medication varies depending on the type of the medication and its instructions. For example, preparing oral medication may simply involve handing the person the correct number of tablets. In Check, Call, Care.",

This is called the secondary assessment. Check the Vital Signs Check the quality of the person’s vital signs by evaluating his or her level of responsiveness, breathing, and skin. Level of Responsiveness: Is the person alert or sleepy? Does the person seem confused? Is the person’s awareness increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? Breathing: Listen for sounds. Is the breathing fast or slow? Effective or adequate? Shallow or deep? Is breathing painful for the person? Skin: Is it dry or wet? Is it an unusual colour or temperature? If the person’s ABCs seem normal, do a secondary assessment to look for injuries or conditions that were not identified in your primary assessment. The secondary assessment consists of three steps: 1. Asking questions 2. Checking the quality of the person’s vital signs 3. Doing an injury check If possible, record the findings from the secondary assessment or have someone else record them to help you remember. When EMS personnel arrive, tell them what you found.

    "content": "Hands-On Check If a person is breathing but unresponsive, or is otherwise unable to communicate what is wrong, you may need to do a hands-on check to assess whether further first aid is required. Conducting a hands-on check involves systematically checking the person from head to toe for signs of injury. Look and feel for any abnormalities such as bumps, soft spots, deformity, bruising, and bleeding. You should also look at the ground around the person for signs of blood or other body fluids. Continue to watch the person’s ABCs and vital signs as you perform this check. If the person’s condition deteriorates, stop the hands- on check and give first aid immediately. Be careful not to reach underneath someone during a hands-on check because there could be glass or other objects that could hurt you. Begin by checking the head, then work downward, focusing on the chest, abdomen, and legs before checking the arms. This prioritizes the areas that are more prone to life-threatening bleeding and organ damage. When checking the chest, feel the ribs for signs of deformity. If the person is unresponsive, watch the rib cage as the person breathes. Both sides should expand at the same time. If the person is responsive, ask him or her to take a deep breath (if it doesn’t cause any pain) to make it easier to check the expansion of the rib cage. When checking the abdomen, press on it gently. It should be soft to the touch. If it feels hard or gentle pressure is painful, check carefully for bruising (some of the person’s clothes may need to be moved or removed at this point). Pushing on a person’s injured pelvis can cause serious injury or worsen an existing condition, so this area should not be touched during the hands-on check. If the person is responsive, you will usually be able to get the information you need from a focused exam and sample questions alone, but there may be situations where touching the person is necessary to assess an injury. If so, you may need to do a portion of the hands-on check, focusing on the injured area. Check, Call, Care.",

    "content": "If you decide it is safe to transport the person yourself, take someone else with you, if possible, to help keep the ill or injured person comfortable and to watch for any changes in his or her condition. This will let you focus on driving safely. Remember to obey traffic laws. No one will benefit if you are involved in a motor vehicle collision or get a speeding ticket on your way to the medical facility. Never let an ill or injured person drive a motor vehicle for any reason. Driving is a high-risk activity that requires concentration, so getting behind the wheel while ill or injured is extremely dangerous. Even a person whose condition is mild could get worse while he or she is driving, and his or her ability to safely operate the vehicle could easily be compromised. Remember that it is not only the health and safety of the driver that is at stake, but that of everyone else on and near the road. Continual Care A person’s condition can change while you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive. Do the following to provide continual care: 1. Have the person rest. 2. Help the person maintain a normal body temperature. 3. Monitor the person’s condition and ABCs. 4. Move the person into the recovery position, if necessary. 5. Give comfort and reassurance to the person. Helping the person stay calm has physiological benefits, such as decreasing the heart rate, reducing pain, slowing and deepening breathing, stabilizing blood pressure, and relaxing the body’s muscles. To help a person calm down and control his or her breathing: 1. Encourage the person to maintain eye contact with you. 2. Have the person breathe in through his or her nose while you raise your arm and count to five. Breathe with the person. 3. Have the person breathe out through his or her mouth, making an audible sound, while you slowly lower your arm and count to ten. 4. Repeat 3 to 5 times, providing encouragement in a calm voice. Should You Transport an Ill or Injured Person to the Hospital? You may decide to take the ill or injured person to a hospital, urgent care clinic, doctor’s office, or community first aid station if: • The person is a friend or family member. • The person’s injuries are minor and non-life-threatening. • There is no risk of the person’s condition getting worse. • There is no risk of the person experiencing an altered level of responsiveness.Shock A person who is ill or injured may go into shock. Shock happens when the vital organs do not get enough oxygen- rich blood. Shock is a life-threatening condition. Common Causes Be on the lookout for shock when providing care for any injury or sudden illness, or when someone has been involved in a serious incident (even if he or she is not badly injured). Shock is often caused by significant fluid loss, for example, diarrhea and vomiting. This is especially true in children, who can become dehydrated more easily. Check, Call, Care.",

    "content": "Providing First Aid for Someone with a Disability It is not uncommon to feel intimidated when providing first aid to a person who has different abilities, because there is often uncertainty about how to care for the person. Remember that people are more similar than they are different, both physiologically and psychologically, and most aspects of first aid care do not vary from person to person. Remember that a person’s particular needs may not be visible, and that the person (or the person’s direct caregiver) is the best source of information about his or her unique situation. If you are unsure, ask what you can do to help. The person is likely to appreciate your consideration. General Tips for Providing First Aid to a Person with a Disability Remember the following tips when providing care for a person with any type of disability: • As with all first aid, you need permission to help and should explain what you intend to do. These basic principles do not change because the person has different abilities. • Avoid stereotypes and make no assumptions about what abilities the person has or does not have. Remember that not all disabilities are visible. • Be confident and reassuring. • If you cannot understand what the person is saying, politely ask him or her to repeat it. • Don’t touch or speak to service animals. They are working and have to pay attention at all times. • Get permission before touching assistive devices, including wheelchairs.Other causes of shock include the following: • Significant blood loss • Heart damage • Extensive burns • Infection • Anaphylaxis • Severe infection (e.g., septicemia) What to Look For The following are signs and symptoms of shock: • Cool, clammy skin • Skin that is paler than normal • Weakness • Confusion • Excessive thirst • Rapid breathing • Drowsiness or loss of responsiveness • Nausea and vomiting What to Do The best thing you can do when a person is in shock is to call EMS/9-1-1. While you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive, provide care by: 1. Caring for the cause of the shock. 2. Having the person rest. 3. Keeping the person warm. 4. Monitoring the person’s ABCs. 5.

    "content": "Providing First Aid for Someone with Vision Loss Examples of vision loss include tunnel vision (where a person cannot see objects to the side), lack of central vision, and total blindness, in which the person receives no visual information from the world around them. Most people with vision loss still have some degree of sight. Keep the following in mind when providing first aid to an individual with vision loss: • If you need to leave the person, let him or her know that you are leaving and will be back. • Narrate your actions so that the person can follow what you are • If you’re unsure about how to provide directions, simply ask the person how he or she would like you to do so. Providing First Aid for Someone with Hearing Loss Keep the following points in mind when providing first aid to an individual with any type of hearing loss: • Get the person’s attention before speaking. The best way to do this is usually by lightly touching the person’s shoulder or gently waving your hand. • Ask the person how you can help. Don’t shout. • If communication is difficult, ask if the person prefers to communicate in another way, such as using a pen and paper. • Be patient if you are using a pen and paper to communicate. American Sign Language may be the person’s first language and it has its own grammatical rules and sentence structure. • If the person uses a hearing aid and you are having trouble communicating, minimize background noise or move to a quieter area, if possible.Providing First Aid for Someone Who Is Deafblind \"Deafblind\" describes people who have some degree of both vision and hearing loss. Many people who are deafblind are accompanied by an intervenor (a professional who helps with communication). If an intervenor is accompanying the person, tell him or her who you are, but then speak directly to the ill or injured person. Don’t touch the person abruptly and don’t touch the person without permission. Providing First Aid for Someone with a Physical Disability There are many different types of physical disability, and not all of them are visible. The important thing is not to diagnose the person: what matters is determining whether the conditions you encounter are pre-existing or whether they are signs of the injury or illness you are providing care for. Keep the following tips in mind when providing first aid to an individual with a physical disability: • Speak naturally to the person (physical and mental disabilities are not the same thing). • Adjust your position if necessary so that you can make eye contact with the person while providing care.

If the person is or becomes too weak to cough, his or her condition will quickly deteriorate into complete choking. If a choking person is unable to cough forcefully for any reason, call EMS/9-1-1 immediately and monitor the person’s condition closely. Complete Choking Complete choking happens when the airway is completely blocked. When a person is experiencing complete choking, he or she is unable to breathe and is in a life-threatening situation. Immediate first aid (and possibly medical intervention) is required to remove whatever is blocking the airway. Common Causes Any medical condition that affects a person’s ability to chew and/or swallow increases his or her risk of choking. So can dental problems or poorly fitting dentures that affect a person’s ability to chew food Common causes of choking include the following: • Trying to swallow large pieces of food • Eating while talking, laughing, walking, or running • Eating too quicklyThe airway is the passage that connects the nose and mouth with the lungs. Choking occurs when the airway becomes partially or completely blocked by a foreign object (e.g., a piece of food or a small toy), by swelling in the mouth or throat, or by fluids, such as vomit or blood. If the airway is blocked by the person’s tongue or by swelling, this is called an anatomical obstruction. If it is blocked by a physical object, this is called a mechanical obstruction. Children younger than 5 years old have a particularly high risk of choking because their airways are about the size of their little fingers, but a person of any age can choke. Anatomy and Physiology The respiratory system consists of the airway and the lungs. When breathing in, air moves from the outside world into the lungs through the airway. The respiratory system constantly supplies the body with the oxygen it needs and removes carbon dioxide. The process is largely involuntary and is controlled by the brain. Partial Choking Partial choking happens when the airway is partially blocked. Coughing is the body’s way of clearing the airway, and so it may indicate a partial airway obstruction. A person who is coughing is still able to breathe. Since forceful coughing usually eliminates the obstruction, encourage the person to keep coughing. Stand by and monitor the person in case further help becomes necessary. Note that the care for complete choking will be ineffective for partial choking, because it depends on creating.",

    "content": "Prevention The following may reduce the risk of choking in adults: • Chewing food well before swallowing • Eating slowly and calmly • Avoiding talking, laughing, walking, and other kinds of physical activity while chewing The following may reduce the risk of choking in children and babies: • When babies start eating solid food, begin with purées as opposed to solid pieces. • Always supervise children and babies when they are eating. • Teach children to eat calmly, chew properly, and not to speak with a mouthful of food. • Encourage children to sit while eating. • Make sure that babies and young children cannot reach objects small enough for them to swallow. • Remember that children can choke on soft plastic (e.g., the cut-off corners of milk bags) and rubber (e.g., burst balloons) as well as hard objects, so keep these items out of reach.What To Do 1. If the person is coughing or can speak, encourage him or her to cough forcefully, and do not interfere. Forceful coughing may be enough to clear the obstruction on its own. 2. Encourage or assist the person to sit upright, if possible, as this will make coughing easier and more effective. 3. Continue to monitor the person’s condition until either the obstruction clears itself or the person’s condition worsens.Typical signs of partial choking include the following: • A look of panic, with wide eyes • Forceful or weak coughing • One or both hands clutching the throat Partial Choking What To Look For It is not usually necessary to call for help for partial choking, though you may need to do so if the obstruction does not clear or the person’s condition worsens. Toys smaller than 4 cm (1.5 in.) in diameter are choking hazards for babies and toddlers. Use the following guideline: if an object can fit through a toilet paper tube, it is not safe for children younger than 4 years old.",

Because every minute counts when a person is experiencing a circulation emergency, the person’s survival often depends on First Aiders acting quickly and giving appropriate care until EMS personnel arrive and take over.Prevention Cardiovascular disease has both controllable and uncontrollable factors. Uncontrollable factors include age, sex, family history, and ethnicity. Fortunately, many risk factors of cardiovascular disease are the result of lifestyle choices and are therefore within a person’s control. Smoking is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, but it is also one of the most controllable factors. Smokers have a risk of sudden death that is 2 to 4 times greater than that of non- smokers. Second-hand and smokeless tobacco also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, the risk starts to drop as soon as a person stops smoking. Compared to a smoker, the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases by half within 1 year of quitting smoking. Within 15 years, the risk is close to that of a non-smoker. Many effective community programs are available for individuals who wish to quit smoking permanently. Cholesterol Cholesterol is produced naturally in the body, and is necessary for cellular function. However, not all cholesterol is good for you: low density lipoproteins (LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\") can build up in the bloodstream and stick to the blood vessel walls, narrowing the blood vessels and reducing blood flow. It is easy to measure cholesterol with a blood test. Cholesterol can be controlled with a proper diet and exercise, along with medication if necessary. Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. It is one of the leading causes of death in Canadians, and it is the underlying cause of many circulation emergencies. Although a circulation emergency such as angina, a heart attack, or a stroke can occur suddenly, the underlying cardiovascular disease often develops over a long period of time. In fact, it can begin as early as the teenage years. Cardiovascular disease occurs when the arteries become hardened and narrowed—a process called atherosclerosis. This damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner artery walls. As this buildup worsens, the arteries become narrower, reducing the amount of blood that can flow through them. The narrowing of arteries increases the risk of artery blockages, which can cause angina, heart attacks, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and strokes. Circulation Emergencies50.",

High blood pressure can be hard to detect, so testing for it should be a routine examination. High blood pressure can be controlled with exercise, diet control, stress reduction, and medication. Obesity directly contributes to heart disease. Middle-aged people who are significantly overweight have 3 times the risk of a fatal heart attack when compared to people who are at a healthy weight. Obesity also increases the risk of high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Maintaining a healthy weight requires exercise and a balanced diet. Stress is a normal part of life. Learning to cope with it well helps you to stay healthy and reduces your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, among other illnesses. Stress can be reduced by developing rewarding hobbies and exercising regularly. It can also be helpful to set realistic goals, practice relaxation exercises, and avoid caffeine, which can reduce your ability to handle What to Look For Heart Attack A heart attack occurs when the heart muscle cannot get enough oxygen because of a blockage in one of the arteries that feeds it. The signs and symptoms of a heart attack vary from person to person, and can be different in women and men. Even a person who has had a heart attack before may not experience the same signs and symptoms if he or she has a second heart attack. A person who is having a heart attack may experience chest pain, which can range from mild to unbearable. The person may complain of pressure, squeezing, tightness, aching, or heaviness in the chest. The pain or discomfort is persistent, lasting longer than 3 to 5 minutes. It is not relieved by resting, changing position, or taking medication. It may be difficult to distinguish the pain of a heart attack from the pain of indigestion, heartburn, or a muscle spasm. Other signs and symptoms of a heart attack include the following: • Discomfort or pain that spreads to one or both arms, the jaw, the shoulder, the neck, or (more commonly in women) the back or the upper part of the stomach • Problems breathing (e.g., noisy breathing, shortness of breath, or breathing that is faster than normal) • Cold, sweaty skin • Skin, lips, and fingers that are bluish, ashen (grey), or paler than normal • Feelings of anxiety, denial, or impending doom Blockage in the artery Damaged heart Circulation Emergencies51.",

This occurs when two factors are combined: 1) the arteries are narrowed by cardiovascular disease, reducing blood flow; and 2) the heart’s oxygen needs are elevated (e.g., during times of physical activity or emotional stress). Angina causes a painful squeezing, suffocating, or burning feeling in the chest. Uncontrolled high blood pressure, anemia, and certain heart disorders can all contribute to a person’s risk of angina. The signs and symptoms of angina are similar to the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, but the pain is usually triggered by physical activity or stress, goes away if the person rests, and is often relieved by medication (e.g., nitroglycerin). Because it is not possible for First Aiders to distinguish between angina and a heart attack, you should treat a person with angina as you would treat a person having a heart attack.Myth-Information Myth: You should delay calling EMS/9-1-1 for a person if you suspect that he or she is experiencing angina and not a full heart attack. You should always call EMS/9-1-1 if you have any reason to suspect that a person might be having a heart attack. It is better to have EMS personnel arrive at a scene and not be needed than to have a person who is having a heart attack not receive medical attention. Many people who are having a heart attack delay seeking care because they hope they are experiencing signs and symptoms of a more minor condition that will go away with time, such as indigestion, heartburn, a muscle strain, or the flu. People often worry about calling EMS/9-1-1 for a \"false alarm.\" Without immediate medical intervention, heart attacks are often fatal, so the risk of not seeking care outweighs any inconvenience. A stroke happens when the blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted, resulting in the death of brain cells. Strokes can cause permanent brain damage, but with quick action, the damage can sometimes be stopped or reversed. Although strokes are most common in older adults, a person of any age, even a child, can have a stroke.Other painkilling medications such as acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol®) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil®) do not have the same effect as ASA in reducing damage due to heart attacks. Do not substitute ASA with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If given in conjunction with nitroglycerin, erectile dysfunction drugs can cause blood pressure to lower to a life-threatening level. If the person has recently taken an erectile dysfunction drug (in the previous 24 to 48 hours), advise the person not to take nitroglycerin. Circulation Emergencies53.",

    "content": "Causes of Stroke Ruptured Aneurysm A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a brain aneurysm ruptures. A brain aneurysm is a swollen, fragile section in the wall of an artery that carries blood to the brain. When it ruptures, it causes bleeding in the surrounding brain tissues, killing the nearby brain cells and causing a As an intact brain aneurysm usually has no signs or symptoms, it can go undetected. However, an unruptured brain aneurysm may press against areas in the brain and, depending on the severity of the aneurysm and its location, it can cause signs and symptoms such as neck pain, acute headaches, blurred vision, and changes in speech. Blood Clot An ischemic stroke occurs when a clot becomes lodged in an artery of the brain, usually because the artery has been narrowed by cardiovascular disease. The blockage prevents blood from reaching the brain cells it usually supplies. Brain Tumour A stroke can also occur when a tumour in the brain presses on an artery. The tumour has a similar effect to a blood clot, resulting in decreased blood flow or a complete blockage of blood flow to part of the brain. Prevention Because the risk factors for stroke are similar to those for heart disease, the risk of a stroke can be reduced by following the same lifestyle changes discussed for preventing cardiovascular disease. What to Look For The signs and symptoms of strokes can vary from person to person. A person who is having a stroke may suddenly develop one or more of the following signs and symptoms: • A sudden, severe headache • Dizziness or confusion • Unresponsiveness or temporary loss of responsiveness • Sudden loss of bladder or bowel control When trying to determine if a person is having a stroke, remember the acronym FACE — Facial numbness or weakness, especially on one side.F T ARM — Arm numbness or weakness, especially on one side. SPEECH — Abnormal speech, difficulty speaking or understanding others, or a loss of speech. TIME — Time is important; call EMS/9-1-1 immediately. Circulation Emergencies54.",

    "content": "Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is also referred to as a \"mini-stroke\" and is caused by a temporary drop in blood flow to part of the brain. A TIA may be caused by a tumour or a clot in an artery in the brain. The signs and symptoms of a TIA are the same as the signs and symptoms of a stroke, but they disappear within a few minutes or hours. A person who has had a TIA is at a very high risk of having a stroke in the near future. In fact, more than 10% of people who have a TIA will have a stroke within 3 months, with half of these strokes happening within 48 hours of the TIA. Myth-Information Myth: A person with a suspected stroke does not need medical attention if his or her signs and symptoms dissipate. TIA signs and symptoms will disappear within a few hours, but the person still needs to be checked by a medical professional. TIAs are warning signs and are often quickly followed by strokes. Always call EMS/9-1-1 if the person has demonstrated signs and symptoms of a TIA or stroke, even if the signs and symptoms have lessened in severity or disappeared completely. Life-Threatening Bleeding Life-threatening bleeding refers to a situation where large amounts of blood loss occur either externally (outside the body) or internally (within the body). Life-threatening bleeding can occur whenever one or more of the body’s blood vessels are broken. It must be controlled immediately. Bleeding from arteries (arterial bleeding) is often rapid and profuse, and it is always life-threatening. This is because arterial blood is under direct pressure from the heart, so it usually spurts from the wound, making it difficult for clots to form. As a result, arterial bleeding is harder to control than bleeding from veins and capillaries.What to Do 1. Have the person rest in a comfortable position. If the person prefers to lie down, or is unresponsive, drooling, or having trouble swallowing, place the person in the recovery CareCall EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. 2. Note when the signs and symptoms first started (or, if you do not know when the signs and symptoms started, note the last time the person was known to be well). 3. Monitor the person’s condition and provide reassurance until EMS personnel arrive; a stroke can be an extremely frightening experience. Some of the medications used to treat strokes can only be administered within a short window of time after the onset of signs and symptoms. It is crucial to note when the person first began to experience the signs and symptoms, or the last time the person was known to be well. Circulation Emergencies55.",

Venous blood is under less pressure than arterial blood and flows from the wound at a steady rate without spurting. Only damage to veins deep in the body, such as those in the torso or thigh, produces profuse bleeding that is hard to control. Prevention The following precautions may reduce the likelihood of an injury that causes life-threatening bleeding: • Be familiar with your surroundings. • Keep all sharp objects, such as knives, in a safe place. • Get proper training on machinery in the workplace. • Always follow the outlined safety procedures when operating equipment. • Wear and use appropriate safety equipment at work and at home. • Only use equipment for its intended purpose. • Stay alert when operating equipment.

    "content": "Using a Tourniquet A tourniquet is a tight band placed around an extremity (e.g., an arm or leg). It constricts blood vessels to stop life- threatening bleeding in circumstances where normal bleeding control is impossible or ineffective. Tourniquets are commercially made, but they can also be improvised with any wide strip of material (e.g., a triangular bandage). If you find yourself in a situation where you need to apply a tourniquet, a commercially manufactured tourniquet is preferred over an improvised device. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for applying the tourniquet. Although tourniquets may have slightly different designs, all are applied in generally the same way. Once a tourniquet is in place, you should not remove it for any reason. When to Apply a Tourniquet Using a tourniquet involves a level of risk, which must be balanced against the potential benefits. You should only apply a tourniquet in the following situations: • The person has life-threatening external bleeding that cannot be controlled using direct pressure. • The person is in a physical location that makes it impossible to apply direct pressure (e.g., the person or the person’s injured limb is trapped in a confined space). • You must move the person and are unable to maintain direct pressure while doing so.Applying a Tourniquet 1. Apply the tourniquet 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in.) above the injury. If there is a joint in this range, apply the tourniquet above it, at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) away from the joint. 2. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops. 3. Secure the tourniquet 4. Document the time the tourniquet was tightened. Circulation Emergencies57.",

    "content": "CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a skill that is used when a person is in cardiac arrest. CPR involves giving sets of 30 chest compressions followed by sets of 2 rescue breaths; it keeps oxygenated blood moving to the brain and other vital organs until advanced medical help arrives. Because we breathe in 21% oxygen and breathe out 16%, even exhaled breath has more than enough to sustain life. Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. Under normal circumstances, a network of special cells in the heart muscle conducts electrical impulses that coordinate contractions, causing the heart to beat rhythmically. In cardiac arrest, the electrical impulses become abnormal and chaotic. This causes the heart to lose the ability to beat rhythmically, or to stop beating altogether. Sudden Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest can happen suddenly and without any warning signs; this is called sudden cardiac arrest. People who have a history of cardiovascular disease or a congenital heart disorder are at higher risk for sudden cardiac arrest. However, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who appear healthy and have no known heart disease or other risk factors for the condition. A person who experiences sudden cardiac arrest is unlikely to survive without immediate care. Clinical and Biological Death Clinical death occurs when breathing stops and the heart stops beating. A person without a heartbeat is clinically dead. Because permanent brain damage does not begin for 4 to 6 minutes, clinical death is reversible with immediate care and intervention. Biological death occurs when the brain becomes irreversibly damaged, which occurs after about 8 to 10 minutes without oxygen. This is also called \"brain death.\" The respiratory and circulatory systems are very closely linked. After breathing stops, it is not long before the heart stops. This is especially true in children: pediatric cardiac arrests are often the result of airway or breathing emergencies. CPR & AED60.",

    "content": "CPR Compression Depth for an Adult When providing CPR to an adult, you should perform compressions in the middle of the chest on the lower half of the sternum. Push deeply and push steadily, ensuring a compression depth of at least 5 cm (about 2 in.), while avoiding excessive depths greater than 6 cm (about 2.5 in.). While there is a risk of injury with compression depths greater than 6 cm, these injuries tend to be non-life-threatening. It is more important to push deeply and push steadily than to worry about pushing too deeply. CPR Compression Depth for a Child or a Baby Because of the variation in size among children or babies, compression depth for this age group is measured as a fraction of the total chest depth, not in centimetres. When providing CPR to a child or baby (i.e., a person who has not yet reached puberty), you should perform chest compressions on the lower half of the sternum and depress the chest to at least 1/3 of its depth. Ideally, chest compressions should be at the upper limit of 1/2 of the front-to-back (anteroposterior) depth. CPR compression depths may be impacted by items such as heavy clothing (e.g., a winter coat or motorcycle jacket) or sports equipment. You should not delay starting CPR to remove them, but you may have to push harder to ensure that the minimum chest compression depth is reached.Chest Compression Rates First Aiders should perform chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute. Counting out loud as you give compressions can help you to keep a steady, even rhythm that allows time for adequate chest recoil. For compressions one through 12, say \"one and two and three and four and five and…\" up to 12. When you get to 13, say the numbers without saying “and” in between: \"13, 14, 15, 16…\" and so on. Push down as you say the number and come up as you say \"and\" or the second syllable of the number. Chest Recoil You should avoid leaning on the person’s chest wall in between compressions. Instead, ensure that the chest recoils fully. It is during recoil that the coronary arteries of the heart are filled with blood and the heart muscle gets oxygen. If you are leaning on the person’s chest between compressions, the coronary arteries will not get sufficient blood flow and heart death can occur. Remember: Compression is for the brain, recoil is for the heart. CPR & AED66.",

    "content": "Myth-Information: Upper-Body Strength Required for CPR Myth: Performing CPR compressions requires significant upper- body strength. If you are performing compressions properly, the power comes from the weight of your upper body, not from your arm muscles. Incorrect technique or body position can cause your arms and shoulders to tire quickly when you are giving compressions. Avoid rocking back and forth, because this makes your compressions less effective and wastes your Decreasing Compression Fraction (Off-Chest Time) During CPR, you should minimize interruptions to chest compressions. Any interruption decreases the total number of compressions given, and therefore the amount of blood that is circulated. Compressions also build up pressure in the person’s arteries: when compressions are interrupted, the arterial pressure drops, which means that the first compressions you give after the interruption are rebuilding the pressure and not yet circulating blood effectively. Interruptions should be limited to critical interventions, such as applying AED pads to the person, allowing the AED to analyze or administer a shock, and clearing the airway. Pause to reassess the person’s ABCs only if there has been an obvious change in the person’s condition. Lengthy ventilation steps (opening airway, excessive breathing) should be avoided. There is no need for you to reposition your hands after every compression—the hand is placed on the middle of chest.Special Considerations CPR for a Pregnant Woman When performing CPR for a pregnant woman, raising her right hip 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 in.) will help blood return to the heart. If a bystander is available (or an appropriate object is within easy reach), ask the person to find a soft object that you can place under the woman’s hip, but do not interrupt or delay starting CPR to find an object yourself. Air in the Stomach When giving rescue breaths, it is important to keep the person’s head-tilted back and breathe with just enough force to cause the chest to rise. Failing to tilt the head back, giving too much air in one breath, or blowing too forcefully can push air into the person’s stomach instead of into his or her lungs. Air in the stomach can make someone vomit. When an unresponsive person vomits, the stomach contents may get into the lungs—this is called aspiration. Aspiration makes giving rescue breaths more difficult and reduces the person’s chance of successful resuscitation. To prevent aspiration, remember to give breaths only until the chest starts to rise. In some situations a person may vomit while you are giving CPR. If this 1. Turn the person onto his or her side, facing you. 2. Quickly wipe the person’s mouth clean. 3. Reposition the person on his or her back and continue with CPR. CPR & AED67.",

Mouth-to-Stoma Breathing Some people have had an operation to remove part of the trachea. They breathe through an opening called a stoma in the front of the neck.

    "content": "Inclement weather: It is safe to use AEDs in all weather conditions, including rain and snow, but their effectiveness can be reduced if the pads are wet. Provide a dry environment if possible (for example, shelter the person with umbrellas), but do not delay defibrillation to do so. An AED is designed to function in a range of weather conditions, but it is still a battery-operated electronic device, and excessive cold, heat, moisture, etc., can result in maintenance errors or prevent the pads from adhering properly. If this happens, move the person into a different environment, if possible, before attempting defibrillation Person-Specific Considerations Pregnancy: It is safe to use an AED on a woman who is pregnant. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): A person who has a known arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) may have a pacemaker or an ICD. These small devices are surgically implanted under the skin to automatically prevent or correct an irregular heartbeat. You may be able to see or feel the outline of the pacemaker or ICD in the area below the person’s collarbone, or the person may wear a medical identification product indicating that he or she has a pacemaker or ICD. If the person has a pacemaker or ICD, adjust the pad placement to avoid placing the AED pads directly over the device, as this can interfere with the delivery of the shock. If you are not sure whether the person has an implanted device, place the pads as you normally would. Transdermal medication patches: Some types of medications, including nitroglycerin and smoking cessation medications, are delivered through patches applied to the skin. Remove any medication patches that you see before applying AED pads. Wear gloves to prevent absorption of the drug through your own skin. Chest hair: Time is critical in a cardiac arrest situation and sparse chest hair rarely interferes with pad adhesion. In most cases, you should proceed as you normally would—attach the AED pads, pressing firmly to ensure adhesion. However, if the person has a great deal of thick chest hair and it seems like it could interfere with pad-to-skin contact, quickly shave the areas where the pads will be placed and then attach the pads. Jewellery and body piercings: You do not need to remove the person’s jewellery or body piercings before using an AED. However, if possible, avoid placing the AED pads directly over any metallic jewellery or piercings. If making a small adjustment to pad placement allows you to avoid the jewellery then do so, but if you must move the pads significantly it is better to place the pads directly over the jewellery. Using an AED on a Child or Baby The procedure for using an AED on a child or baby is the same as the procedure for using an AED on an adult. Some AEDs come with pediatric AED pads that are smaller and designed to deliver a less powerful shock. These pads should be used on children up to 8 years of age or weighing less than 55 pounds. Other AEDs have a key or switch that configures the AED for use on a child. If pediatric AED pads are not available or the AED does not have a pediatric setting, it is safe to use the adult pads and setting on a child or baby. Medical Direction and AEDs In some professions, defibrillation is designated as a controlled medical act. If you are providing care under the authority of a medical director, he or she may choose to adopt different protocols than those of the Canadian Red Cross. The specific protocols will be written in a standing order. You should always follow the instructions of your medical director. The Canadian Red Cross accepts no responsibility for any modifications made to the AED protocol set out in this text. CPR & AED73.",

    "content": "AED Maintenance AEDs require minimal maintenance, but it is important to check them regularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions or your employer’s policy. This ensures that they remain in good working order and are ready for use whenever they are needed. To ensure that your AED is ready to use: • Familiarize yourself with the owner’s manual and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance. • Familiarize yourself with the method the AED uses to indicate the status of the device. Many AEDs have a status indicator that displays a symbol or illuminates to indicate that the AED is in proper working order and ready to respond. The status indicator may also display symbols indicating that routine maintenance is needed (e.g., a battery change) or that a problem with the device has been detected. Some AEDs have a warning indicator that will illuminate or beep if the AED is not in proper working order or requires maintenance. • Check regularly to make sure that the battery is properly installed and has not reached its expiration date. • Make sure AED pads are adequately stocked, stored in a sealed package, and within their expiration date. • After using the AED, make sure that all supplies are restocked and that the device is in proper working order. • If at any time the AED fails to work properly or warning indicators appear, take the AED out of service and contact the manufacturer or the appropriate person at your place of employment (according to your employer’s policy). You may need to return the AED to the manufacturer for service. If the AED stops working during an emergency, continue giving CPR until EMS personnel take over.Working as a Team Remember: when you are giving CPR, you want to give high-quality compressions at the appropriate depth and rate and to minimize interruptions to compressions. If you are the only trained First Aider at the scene, you will begin to tire as you give CPR, and the quality of your compressions will diminish. You will also need to stop CPR to ready the AED for use when it arrives, which means that during that time there will be no oxygenated blood moving through the person’s body. Working as a team can increase the chance of survival for the person in cardiac arrest. First Aiders can share the responsibility for giving compressions, switching off every 2 minutes. This reduces fatigue and leads to higher-quality compressions. Having two or more First Aiders at the scene also minimizes interruptions to chest compressions when the AED arrives. One First Aider should begin CPR while the second calls EMS/9-1-1, obtains the AED, and readies it for use by turning the device on, applying the pads to the person’s chest, and plugging in the connector cable, if necessary. The First Aider performing CPR should not pause CPR until the AED is ready to analyze the person’s heart rhythm and the second First Aider tells everyone to stand clear. While the AED is analyzing, the First Aiders should switch roles. The First Aider who is taking over compressions should hover with his or her hands positioned just above the person’s chest so that he or she can immediately start compressions as soon as the AED prompts that a shock was delivered or that no shock was advised. The First Aiders then switch roles every time the AED analyzes the person’s heart rhythm, which occurs every 2 minutes. CPR & AED74.",

    "content": "A person who is having difficulty breathing is in respiratory distress. A person who is not breathing is in respiratory arrest. Both respiratory distress and respiratory arrest are breathing emergencies. Respiratory distress is especially dangerous in children, as it can quickly lead to cardiac arrest. Any child showing signs of respiratory distress is in a potentially life-threatening situation and must receive immediate care. When a person is experiencing a breathing emergency, the oxygen supply to the person’s body is either greatly reduced or cut off entirely, so it is important to act at once. If breathing stops or is restricted long enough, the person will become unresponsive, the heart will stop beating, and body systems will quickly fail. Brain cells begin to die after 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen. A breathing problem can be identified by watching and listening to the person’s breathing and by asking the person how he or she feels. If a person is having trouble breathing, do not wait to see if his or her condition improves without intervention, but begin providing care immediately.Respiratory Distress Common Causes Respiratory distress may be caused by any of the following: • Hyperventilation • Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) • Pneumonia or bronchitis • An allergic reaction • Anaphylaxis • A heart attack or heart failure • Chest trauma • Poisoning • A drug overdose • Electrocution • Certain mental health conditions (e.g., panic disorders) What to Look For The following are signs and symptoms of respiratory distress: • Shortness of breath or gasping for breath • Trouble speaking in complete sentences (due to difficulty breathing) • Wheezing, gurgling, or high-pitched noises • Breathing abnormally quickly or slowly • Unusually deep or shallow breathing • Cool, moist skin • Bluish or ashen (grey) skin • Flushed or pale skin • Feelings of fear • Dizziness or light-headedness Breathing Emergencies76.",

This upsets the body’s balance of oxygen and carbon Common Causes The following are common causes of hyperventilation: • Strong emotions such as excitement, fear, or anxiety • Injuries, especially injuries to the head • Exercise • Life-threatening bleedingPrevention If you tend to hyperventilate due to anxiety, panic, or stress, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises may help. If you hyperventilate due to a diagnosed medical condition, speaking to your doctor will help you learn how to treat or control it. What to Look ForCall Call EMS/9-1-1. 1. If the person carries medication for respiratory distress, offer to help the person take his or her medication. 2. Encourage the person to sit down in a comfortable position (leaning forward may help make breathing easier). 3. Provide reassurance, as this can help reduce anxiety and help the person control his or her breathing. 4. Monitor the person’s condition and provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive.The following are signs and symptoms of hyperventilation: • Rapid, shallow breathing • A feeling of suffocating or not getting enough air • Fear, anxiety, or confusion • A feeling of dizziness • Numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes • Muscle contractions, usually in the hands, feet, arms, and legs What to Do It is not always necessary to call EMS/9-1-1 for a person who is hyperventilating. You should call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the hyperventilation does not stop after a few minutes, the person becomes unresponsive, or you suspect that the person is hyperventilating because of an injury or illness. 1.

    "content": "Myth-Information Myth: If a person is hyperventilating, you should have him or her breathe into a paper bag. This practice is unsafe and not recommended as a way to care for a hyperventilating person. The best way to treat hyperventilation is to encourage the person to take slow, controlled breaths. Many people have asthma—a chronic illness in which certain substances or conditions (i.e., triggers) cause inflammation and swelling of the bronchioles (i.e., the small tubes at the base of the lungs), making it harder for air to move in and out of the lungs. Asthma is more common in children. People who have asthma usually know what can trigger an attack and take measures to avoid these triggers. Asthma is usually controlled with medication. Common Causes Asthma can be triggered by: • Air pollution or poor air quality (e.g., cigarette smoke) • Allergies (e.g., to pollen, food, drugs, insect stings, or animals) • Temperature fluctuations, extreme humidity, or extreme dryness • Strong odours (e.g., perfume, cologne, scented cleaning products) • Colds and flus • Physical activity • Respiratory infections • Stress or anxietyPrevention If you have asthma, the following precautions may help to prevent attacks: • Know what triggers your attacks and avoid them if possible. • Ensure that prescribed medication is always easily accessible in case of an attack. If a child has asthma: • Make sure that anyone who supervises the child knows about the asthma and how to help give medication if necessary. Asthma Medications There are two main types of medication used by people with asthma: Long-term control medication and quick-relief (rescue) medication. A person with asthma may take one, both, or neither of them. Both long- term control medications and quick-relief (rescue) medications may be given through an inhaler, through a nebulizer, or orally. Long-term control medications, sometimes called \"preventers,\" are taken regularly, whether or not signs and symptoms of asthma are present. These medications help prevent asthma attacks by reducing inflammation and swelling and by making the bronchioles less sensitive to triggers. Quick-relief (rescue) medications are taken when a person is experiencing an acute asthma attack. These medications are sometimes called \"bronchodilators,\" because they work quickly to relax the muscles that tighten around the bronchioles, opening (dilating) them immediately so that the person can breathe more easily. 7878 Breathing Emergencies78.",

The signs and symptoms of an asthma attack include the following: • Wheezing or coughing, especially when exhaling • Gasping for air • Shortness of breath (feeling unable to get enough air into the lungs) • Rapid, shallow breathing (or trouble breathing) • Anxiety and fear • Tightness in the chest • Tingling in the hands and feet • Sweating • Inability to say more than a few words without pausing to breatheCall EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the person is struggling to breathe, the person’s breathing does not improve after taking his or her medication, or the person becomes unresponsive. 1. Eliminate any asthma triggers, if possible. If something in the environment is causing the attack, move the person away from the area if it is safe to do so. 2. Help the person get into a comfortable position and provide reassurance. 3. Help the person to take any prescribed quick-relief asthma medication that he or she has available. Providing Care for an Asthma Attack: Using an Asthma Action Plan An individual who is at risk for ongoing asthma attacks may have a written plan that outlines the assessment and treatment steps, and clarifies when to call EMS/9-1-1. This is most common for children in child care situations. If you are a caregiver for a person who has an asthma action plan, familiarize yourself with it and be sure you understand what to do if the person has an attack. Breathing Emergencies79.",

Allergic Reactions Normally, our immune systems help to keep us healthy by fighting off harmful pathogens that can cause disease. In a person with an allergy, however, the immune system can react to normally harmless substances to produce allergic reactions. An allergic reaction occurs in two stages. First, the immune system mistakes a normally harmless substance for a dangerous invader and produces antibodies that remain on alert for that particular allergen. When the body is exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies release a number of immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms. While certain substances are more common as allergens (e.g., peanuts and pollen), almost anything can produce an allergic reaction. The severity of an allergic reaction depends on the person. It can be as 8080 Breathing Emergencies80.",

The signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction depend on the trigger, but they typically involve the airways, skin, sinuses, nasal passages, cardiovascular system, and digestive systems. Preventing Allergic Reactions in a Child You Are Caring For Discuss the allergy with the parent or guardian before you begin caring for the child, and ask at least the following questions: • What is your child allergic to? • What signs will tell us that your child is having an allergic reaction? • What should we do if your child has a reaction? • Has the doctor prescribed any allergy medication? For instance, should you give us your child’s epinephrine auto-injector? Make a list of the allergies of each child under your care, and keep it in a location where you can refer to it easily, especially in cooking and food service areas. Be sure to read all the ingredients on all food package labels when preparing and cooking food. Before serving a food that is a common allergen (e.g., eggs, shellfish, milk, nuts), ensure that the parent or guardian has given it to the child at home without causing a reaction. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from mild to very severe and include the following: • Runny, itchy, or stuffy nose • Sneezing • Watery, itchy, red, or swollen eyes • Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea • A rash or hives (raised, itchy areas • Tingling of the mouth • Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or • Coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, or shortness of breath • Weakness, dizziness, or confusion What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the reaction is severe, the person is struggling to breathe, or the person loses responsiveness. 1. Calm and reassure the person. 2. Try to identify the allergen and have the person avoid further contact with it. 3. Watch the person for signs of increasing distress. 4.

    "content": "What to Look For Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction. While mild allergic reactions are localized, anaphylaxis is a body-wide reaction and it can cause system-wide inflammation and swelling. In some cases, the air passages swell, making it difficult to breathe. It is important to act quickly when a person is experiencing anaphylaxis, as it can lead to death if it is not cared for immediately.The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may be similar to the signs and symptoms of a mild allergic reaction, but they are more pronounced. A person experiencing an anaphylactic emergency may develop one or more signs and symptoms within seconds or minutes of coming into contact with the allergen. Anaphylaxis can affect a variety of body systems and can present in various ways. If a person exhibits signs and symptoms from two or more of these categories—especially after contact with an allergen—you should provide care for anaphylaxis: • Skin (e.g., swelling of the lips, face, neck, ears, and/or hands, a raised, itchy, blotchy rash, flushing, or hives) • Breathing (e.g., a feeling of tightness in the chest or throat, coughing, wheezing, or high-pitched noises) • Alertness (e.g., weakness, dizziness, or unresponsiveness) • Stomach (e.g., stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) What to DoCommon Causes Anything that causes other allergic reactions can also cause anaphylaxis, and the causes vary from one person to another. The most common allergens that trigger anaphylaxis include: • Insect stings • Medications Prevention The following steps may help to prevent an anaphylactic incident: • Avoid the substances, foods, or insects that cause reactions. • Wear a medical identification product and carry the appropriate medication at all times.Call Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.Antihistamines An antihistamine is a medication that counteracts the effects of histamine (a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction). Antihistamines are supplied as pills, capsules, or liquids and are taken by mouth. The person should take the antihistamine according to the medication label and his or her healthcare provider’s instructions. Breathing Emergencies82.",

If a person has a risk of experiencing anaphylaxis, he or she may carry an epinephrine auto-injector (a syringe system that contains a single dose of epinephrine). Different brands of epinephrine auto-injectors may be available, but all work in a similar fashion. Some have audio prompts to guide the user. Different auto-injectors contain difference doses based on the weight of the person (0.15 mg for children weighing between up to 30 kg (66 lb.), and 0.3 mg for children and adults weighing more than 30 kg (66 lb.)). Many healthcare providers advise that people with a known history of anaphylaxis carry at least two doses of epinephrine (two auto-injectors) with them at all times. This is because more than one dose may be needed to stop an anaphylactic reaction. The second dose should be administered if the person is still having signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis 5 minutes after the first dose. Breathing Emergencies84.",

    "content": "Wounds such as bruises, scrapes, and small cuts are very common injuries, and are caused in a variety of ways. Prevention The following general tips will help you to avoid both serious and minor wounds: • Develop safe habits, such as never running with sharp objects. • Use proper safety equipment when playing sports or engaging in recreational activities. • Wear proper safety equipment in the workplace, and request training before using any potentially dangerous tools or equipment. • Stay alert and focused when engaged in any potentially risky activity.Bandaging Guidelines • Use clean, preferably sterile, dressings. • Check circulation below the injury before and after applying a bandage. If circulation is reduced, loosen the bandage. • If blood soaks through the bandage, place more dressings and another bandage on top. The dressing that is in contact with the wound should remain in place and not be removed. • Dressings and bandages should be kept clean and dry to decrease the risk of infection. Once bleeding is under control and the wound has begun to heal, dressings that become wet should be replaced with dry dressings.Stages of Wound Healing Wounds go through several phases during the healing process. The first stage is the body’s natural response to injury. It is at this stage that the characteristic signs of inflammation can be seen: heat, swelling, and pain. Infection is most prominent during the first stage of healing, but can occur at any time. The second stage is where tissue is rebuilt by the body. The area will slowly heal with tissue that is sensitive and pink or red. This new skin tissue will slowly toughen and thicken during the final stage of healing. 1.

You may be dealing with internal bleeding, head and/ or spinal injuries, or a bone, muscle, or joint injury. Care for the injury accordingly. 1. Using ice or another cold source, cool the injured area to help reduce pain and swelling. Place some sort of cloth, towel, or pad between the cold source and the skin to reduce the risk of freezing.2. Apply the cold source for 20 minutes and then take it off for 20 to 30 minutes. Continue to do this for as long as the person keeps feeling pain. A splinter (or \"sliver\") is a sharp, thin piece of material that is stuck in the surface of the skin. If the splinter is completely below the skin, encourage the person to seek medical attention rather than attempting to remove it What to Do 1. Gently grab the exposed end of the splinter with tweezers and carefully pull it out. 2. Wash the area with water and apply a bandage. Wound Care95.",

    "content": "What to Do It is imperative that a person with a head, neck, or spinal injury remain as still as possible, unless keeping him or her in the position found would actually put the person’s life at risk (if the scene is becoming unsafe, for example, or if you must roll the person over to put pressure on life- threatening bleeding). As always, an unresponsive person should be rolled into the recovery position. The risk of further damage to the spine is less serious than the risk of the person’s airway being obstructed. You should take steps to discourage the person from moving reflexively. For example, if the person is lying on the ground, approach from a direction that allows the person to see you without turning his or her head. You should also tell the person to respond verbally to your questions rather than nodding or shaking his or her head. If the person is unresponsive, you must check his or her ABCs, but this can often be done without moving the person. If you can see chest movement or can hear the person moaning, crying, or coughing, that means the person is breathing. Do not attempt to remove a person’s helmet or remove a child from a car seat unless it prevents you from checking the ABCs or providing care for a life-threatening condition. Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. Care 1. Restrict movement of the head, neck, and spine as much as you can until EMS personnel arrive: • If the person is responsive, instruct him or her to keep as still as possible. If the person is unable to do so, manually support the head in a position that limits • If the person is unresponsive and breathing, manually support the person’s head in the position found. 2. Keep the person in the position he or she was found, unless the person is in immediate danger or has life-threatening conditions that need immediate attention. 3. If blood or other fluid is in the ear canal or draining from the ear: • Let the ear drain. Do not apply direct pressure. Do not move the person unless it is absolutely necessary. • Cover the ear loosely with a sterile dressing. Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries111.",

    "content": "When to Move a Person with a Head, Neck, or Spinal Injury You may need to move a person with a head, neck, and/or spinal injury in the following situations: • The person’s airway is blocked (for example, if the person vomits) • The scene of the emergency becomes dangerous • There is no organized EMS response in the region (for example, if the injury occurs in a very remote area) When moving the person, try to keep the head, neck, and spine in the position you found them. Avoid unnecessary jostling and move the person only as much as is necessary. Remember, it is more important to treat life-threatening conditions than it is to keep the person still. If the person has a potential spinal injury and is not breathing, opening the airway and starting CPR immediately are more important than protecting the spine from further damage.A concussion can result from even a seemingly minor bump, blow, or jolt, and may be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms may not be immediately obvious. Concussions are evolving injuries, with the effects intensifying, dissipating, or changing unexpectedly in the days and weeks following the event of the injury. Depending on the severity of the concussion, signs and symptoms can last for days, weeks, or even months. The majority of concussions, however, resolve in a short period It is not fully known exactly what happens to brain cells in a concussion, but a change in the brain’s chemical function seems to be involved in the process. As a result, concussions are rarely visible in neuroimaging scans. The exact duration of this altered function is not yet known, but during the recovery period the brain is more susceptible to further injury. A person who has had one concussion is at increased risk for future concussions. As a result, it is critical that as soon as someone is suspected of having a concussion, they are removed from activity and seek care from a qualified medical professional. A person does not need to become unresponsive to have incurred a concussion. Common Causes A concussion may be caused by: • A blunt force to the head or jaw • An explosion • Whiplash • A forceful blow to the body • Shaking (in the case of a baby) Concussion A concussion is a subset of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that involve a temporary alteration in brain function. An impact to the head or upper body can create forces that cause the brain to \"shake\" inside the skull. This shaking can cause the brain to collide with the bony structures that make up the skull’s inner shell (sometimes causing swelling and/or bleeding), or to rotate within the skull, which can shear or tear the brain nerve fibres and sometimes stretch and damage the brain cells.

    "content": "Concussions are often left untreated because the symptoms are not always recognized by the person who has been injured, and the signs are not always obvious to others. There may also be personal or external pressures to continue participating in the activity at hand (e.g., workplace requirements, social events, or sporting activities), instead of avoiding such aggravating factors. Continued participation in activities that provoke symptoms during either the acute or the recovery stage can re- aggravate the condition due to raised levels of exertion. To avoid this, it is important that the person seek medical attention following a blow to the head, neck, or upper body with any concussion symptoms. Cessation of physical activity and the promotion of cognitive rest (reducing \"screen time\" and other activities that require concentration) are critical to the resolution of concussion injuries. Concussion Signs and Symptoms in Children and Babies Identifying signs and symptoms of a concussion in a child is more difficult than for an adult. It is particularly difficult for a child or baby, since the child or baby may not be able to speak to describe the symptoms. In addition to the standard signs of a concussion, the child or baby may exhibit the following signs, which are more specific to this age group: • Disturbed sleeping and eating patterns • Excessive crying • Disinterest in activities or favourite toys Children may also express simply \"feeling off\" or \"not feeling right\" following a physical impact. This is also a possible symptom of a concussion.What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 if the person has the following more severe signs and symptoms of a concussion: • Repeated or projectile vomiting • Loss of responsiveness of any duration • Lack of physical coordination (e.g., stumbling and unusual clumsiness) • Confusion, disorientation, or memory loss • Changes to normal speech • Seizures • Vision and ocular changes (e.g., double vision, dilated pupils, or unequal pupil size) • Persistent dizziness or loss of balance • Weakness or tingling in the arms or legs • Severe or increasing headacheCall If you think a person has sustained a concussion, advise the person to stop the activity he or she was engaged in when the incident occurred. If the person sustains an injury that causes a jolt or blow to the head or body, and then displays any signs and symptoms of a concussion, you should assume that a concussion has occurred. The person should follow up with a qualified healthcare provider as soon as possible for a full evaluation. A healthcare provider is best able to evaluate the severity of the injury and make recommendations about when the person can return to normal activities. While rare, permanent brain damage and death are potential consequences of failing to identify and respond to a concussion in a timely manner. Prompt recognition of when a potential concussion injury has occurred, immediate removal from the activity, and appropriate follow-up care are key elements in preventing catastrophic consequences.114114 Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries114.",

These people can also have a positive impact on concussion recovery by supporting the person and encouraging him or her to follow the concussion recovery plan outlined by the doctor. Proper management of the person’s signs and symptoms by a qualified healthcare provider will help to avoid future problems that may lead to permanent issues and a diminished quality of life. If treated improperly, concussions can cause a wide range of functional long-term changes affecting thinking, sensation, language, and/or emotions. Concussions can also cause long-term neurological conditions, such as seizure disorders, and, in the most severe cases, death. Shaken Baby Syndrome Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) refers to a variety of injuries that may result when a baby or a young child is violently shaken. This causes the brain to move within the skull, forcing blood vessels to stretch and tear. SBS is most associated with babies and toddlers, but can occur in children up to 5 years old. SBS is the most common cause of mortality in babies. It is the most frequent cause of long-term disability in babies and young children, and it can cause permanent brain damage. SBS differs from other forms of physical abuse in that it is frequently a single event and there may be no obvious sign of injury. Often there is no intent to harm the baby. Inconsolable crying is the most common trigger that leads a person to shake a baby. When trying to console a crying baby, never shake the baby, no matter what. Instead, place the baby face-up in a safe place and let the baby cry. Take a few deep breaths and then try again to soothe the baby. Other common triggers are feeding problems and difficulties with toilet training. Feelings of anger and frustration can be overwhelming. However, shaking a child or baby is never appropriate. If you feel like you might lose control, stop! Take a break, never shake. Place the child in a safe Anyone who exhibits more concerning signs and symptoms requires immediate medical evaluation. An injury that causes a concussion may also trigger bleeding in or around the brain, leading to symptoms like extended drowsiness and confusion. This type of bleeding can be life- threatening. The person must be monitored in the immediate hours after the injury to ensure that the symptoms do not progress or worsen, as this can indicate additional brain injuries that require emergency care. Myth-Information Myth: A person with a concussion who falls asleep could die. It is generally considered safe for a person with a concussion to go to sleep. However, the person’s healthcare provider may recommend that you wake the person periodically to make sure that his or her condition has not worsened. Follow-Up Care for Concussions It is important that the person seek medical advice from a doctor, ideally one who specializes in concussions, since signs and symptoms can escalate in the days or weeks following the injury. A person who has suffered a concussion should not participate in any physical activities until a doctor gives permission to do so. Activities that require concentration (e.g., reading) and visual stimulation, such as working on a computer, texting, etc. should also be reduced to allow the brain the opportunity to recover from cognitive stressors. When given permission from a doctor, it is important to resume all of these activities gradually and be monitored by a medical professional. A person recovering from a concussion may not be able to effectively monitor his or her own symptoms, and may not make the best decisions about things like rest, sleep, and limiting visual stimulation. It is crucial that the person’s family members, caregivers, friends, or colleagues note any changes in his or her sleep habits or physical, cognitive, or emotional behaviour, as any of these can indicate that the recovery phase has 115115 Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries115.",

    "content": "Bone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries10.\n\nBones are strong, hard, dense, tissues that come in many different sizes and shapes. More than 200 bones make up the skeleton, creating the framework for the body. Muscles are soft tissues that can contract and relax. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons and move the body when they receive signals from the brain. A joint is formed where two or more bones are held together by ligaments that allow movement. Bones, muscles, and joints have many jobs: • Supporting the body • Protecting internal organs • Allowing movement • Storing minerals • Producing blood cells • Producing heat through movement There are four basic types of bone, muscle, and joint injuries:Dislocation: Occurs when the bones that meet at a joint move out of their normal position. This type of injury is usually caused by a violent force that tears the ligaments, allowing the bones to move out of place. Sprain: Occurs when a ligament is stretched, torn, or damaged. Ligaments connect bones together at the joints. Sprains most commonly affect the ankle, knee, wrist, and finger joints.Muscle Cramps A muscle cramp is a painful condition that can be caused by heavy exercise or staying in the same position for too long. You can usually stop the pain by stretching and massaging the area with the cramp, resting, or changing position. Common Causes Bone, muscle, and joint injuries can occur in many ways. The causes include the following: • Awkward or sudden movements • Direct blows to the body • Repetitive actions or forces, such as joggingStrain: Occurs when a tendon or muscle is stretched, torn, or damaged. Tendons connect muscles to bones. Strains are often caused by overworking a muscle (e.g., by lifting an overly heavy object or by repetitively performing the same action). They usually involve the muscles in the neck, back, thigh, or the back of the lower leg. Fracture: A complete break, chip, or crack in a bone. Fractures can be open (if the end of the broken bone breaks through the skin) or closed (the broken bone does not break through the skin). Open fractures are also called \"compound fractures.\" Bone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries118.",

Children should learn their limits and rest when they are too tired or frustrated to continue safely. Falls are the leading cause of injuries among the elderly. Reduce the risk with safety measures such as: • Good lighting. • Sturdy railings on staircases. • Non-slip floors and rugs. The signs and symptoms of bone, muscle, and joint injuries may include the following: • Pain, deformity, swelling, or • Limited or no use of the injured • A broken bone or bone fragments sticking out of the skin • A sensation or sound of bones • Possible muscle cramps • The sound of a snap or a pop when the injury happened What to Do The person may be anxious and in a lot of pain. In most cases, the best thing that you can do is keep the person comfortable and prevent further injury until the person receives medical attention. To avoid damaging nerves, blood vessels, and tissues, do not perform traction or any other manipulation. When caring for an open fracture, your first priority is to stop any bleeding. Provide care as you would for any other open wound. Bone, muscle, and joint injuries range from very minor to life-threatening, so you must determine whether there is a need to call EMS/9-1-1.

Applying heat causes the blood vessels in the area to dilate (widen), bringing more blood to the area and increasing swelling. Cold, on the other hand, causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow), reducing blood flow to the area and helping to reduce swelling. In addition, applying cold slows the nerve impulses and helps to reduce pain. Treat the injury using the RICE method: Splinting Guidelines Splinting involves securing an injured bone or joint to keep it from moving, which reduces the risk of further injury and helps reduce pain. However, you should apply a splint only if you must move a person to get medical help or if the EMS response will be delayed. Common items such as rolled newspapers, scarves, belts, and pillows can be used to improvise slings and splints if commercial versions are not available. Medical tape and medical braces can also be used to support strains and sprains. REST — Have the person stop any current activities and rest without moving or straightening the injured body part.R E IMMOBILIZE — If you need to move the person or if EMS response will be delayed, immobilize the injured area in the position in which it was found by creating a splint. Otherwise keep the person still and do not splint the injury. COOL — If it does not cause the person any discomfort, cool the injured area for 20 minutes of every hour to reduce swelling and pain. The part should be cooled for 20 minutes of every hour for up to 48 hours. Do not rub the ice or cold pack on the injured area. If you use ice, put some sort of thin, dry cloth or pad between it and the person’s bare skin to avoid freezing the skin. ELEVATE — Keep the injured area above the level of the heart, if possible. However, do not raise the injured area if moving it will cause pain. 120120 Bone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries120.",

    "content": "An acute illness is one that strikes suddenly and usually only lasts for a short period of time. A chronic illness is an illness that a person lives with on an ongoing basis and that often requires continuous treatment to manage. When a person becomes suddenly ill, it may be the result of an acute illness, or it may be an acute flare-up of a chronic condition. Signs and symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain that is persistent or severe, problems seeing or speaking, problems with sensation or movement, seizures, or unresponsiveness require a call to EMS/9-1-1. If you are unsure about the severity of the illness, it is better to call for help early than to wait for the situation to progress. Fortunately, you do not need to know exactly what is wrong to provide appropriate first aid care in a sudden medical emergency. If your initial check of the person reveals any life-threatening conditions, make sure that someone calls EMS/9-1-1 right away, and then provide care according to the signs and symptoms that you find and your level of training. Follow the same general guidelines you would for any emergency.Common Causes Fainting is caused by a sudden decrease in blood flow to the brain. Usually the cause of fainting is not serious. The following are common causes of fainting: • Pregnancy • Dehydration • Decreased blood sugar (e.g., from missing a meal) • Standing in one position for too long without moving • Intense emotion • Traumatic information (e.g., news of someone’s death) Prevention The following tips help prevent fainting: • Keep hydrated. • Eat at regular intervals to maintain a consistent blood sugar level. • Get up slowly from sitting or laying down. Fainting may be preceded by paleness, dizziness, sweating, or nausea. If you think that someone is about to faint, have the person sit or lie down. What to Do Fainting is a brief period of unresponsiveness that happens when there is not enough blood flowing to the brain. If a person suddenly becomes unresponsive and then \"comes to\" after about a minute, he or she may have simply fainted. Call Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the person is unresponsive for more than a few minutes, the person is pregnant, the person’s medical history is unknown, or you suspect that the person fainted as a result of a serious injury or illness.

    "content": "A person may experience an aura (an unusual sensation or feeling) before the onset of the seizure. If the person recognizes the aura, he or she may have time to tell someone what is happening and sit down before the seizure occurs. There are many different types of seizures, and their specific signs and symptoms vary. Common types of seizures include: Tonic-Clonic or Convulsive Seizures: Formerly called \"Grand Mal\" seizures. The person becomes unresponsive and has convulsions. During the tonic phase, muscles will stiffen. Then, during the clonic phase, the extremities will jerk and twitch rhythmically. Saliva that has not been swallowed during the seizure may appear as froth at the mouth. Breathing may be irregular as the respiratory muscles can be affected. A tonic-clonic seizure usually lasts one to three minutes, but may last up to five minutes. The period after the seizure is called the post-ictal phase. During this time, What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if:What to Look For The following are common signs and symptoms of seizures:Common Causes Seizures can have many different causes. One common cause is epilepsy, a chronic seizure disorder that can often be controlled with medication. Other causes of seizures include the following: Any one of these signs can indicate a seizure—not all seizures involve convulsions.the body rests to recover from the seizure. The person will slowly regain responsiveness and may appear fatigued, confused, or disoriented. Absence Seizures: Formally called \"Petit Mal\" seizures. The person experiences a brief, sudden lapse in responsiveness. He or she may momentarily become very quiet and have a blank stare, or appear to be daydreaming. The person may also make chewing motions, breathe rapidly, blink rhythmically, or make slight movements such as tugging at clothing. There are no convulsions with absence seizures. Absence seizures are very brief, usually lasting between two and ten seconds. There is no confusion after the seizure, and the person can usually resume full activity immediately. Focal or Partial Seizures: These seizures begin in one specific part of the brain. The signs and symptoms of the seizure vary depending on which region of the brain is affected. Typically a focal or partial seizure will affect only one part of the body (e.g., one arm may convulse) or aspect of experience (e.g., a person’s vision could be disturbed, or a person could experience a sudden change in his or her emotional state). The person may or may not remain aware during the seizure. Some focal or partial seizures can evolve into a generalized tonic-clonic or convulsive seizure.• Fevers or infections • Head injuries • Heat stroke • Poisons (including drugs)• Drug or alcohol withdrawal • Diabetic emergencies • Audio-visual stimulation (e.g., flashing lights) • Hallucinations • Uncontrollable muscle • Eyes rolling upward into the head• Drool or foaming at the mouth • Uncontrolled repetitive motions (partial seizures) • You do not know the person or the person’s medical history. • The seizure lasts more than a few minutes. • The person has several seizures • The person appears to be • The person is pregnant. • The person is experiencing a diabetic emergency. • The seizure takes place in water. • This is the person’s first seizure, or the cause of the seizure is • The person does not wake up after the seizure or is unresponsive for an extended period.130130 Sudden Medical Emergencies130.",

    "content": "Febrile Seizures Babies and young children may have seizures if their body temperatures suddenly rise. These are called \"febrile seizure\" and are most commonly associated with sudden high fevers, normally with temperatures over 39°C (102°F). In most cases, these seizures are non-life-threatening and do not last long. To reduce the risk of febrile seizures in a child or baby with a high fever, you must lower his or her body temperature:Mental Health Crisis Mental health first aid is the initial care given by a First Aider to a person in a mental health crisis. Like any first aid, it includes the recognition of signs and symptoms and the care that can be given until either appropriate professional follow-up care is received or the crisis is resolved. Call EMS/9-1-1 for a febrile seizure if: • It is the first time that the child or baby has had a febrile seizure. • The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or is repeated. • The seizure is followed by a quick increase in body temperature. A First Aider is not a therapist, but rather a listener. Your role is to look, listen, and feel empathy for the person’s situation and provide both physical and mental health first aid as necessary. You may also need to refer the person to the appropriate follow-up care, just as you might when caring for physical conditions. Mental Health Conditions Mental health conditions are difficult to identify. They may go unrecognized unless the person shares the information with you. People in distress can be suffering from a number of disorders including substance-related disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders or, less commonly, psychotic disorders. A person with a mental health condition may experience one, many, or none of the following symptoms: • Inability to think clearly • Inability to concentrate or focus on a task • Hallucinations (e.g., hearing voices, seeing, or feeling things that aren’t there) • Delusions • Depression or acute mood swings (e.g., from happy to depressed with no clear reason for the change) • Poor memory • Obvious lack of motivation1. Remove any excess clothing or blankets. 2. Give the child or baby a sponge bath with water that is room temperature (not icy cold). 3. Give the child or baby plenty of fluids to drink to help prevent dehydration. 4. Consider giving the child or baby fever-reducing medication such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If these steps do not reduce the child’s or baby’s temperature, seek medical attention. Sudden Medical Emergencies132.",

    "content": "What to Do Helping a person through a mental health crisis can be achieved by using active listening practices: • Reduce distractions and encourage the person to sit down to promote conversation. • Keep the person as calm as possible. • Listen empathetically. • Acknowledge the person’s feelings and emotions without judgment. • If the person is delusional, do not dismiss his or her beliefs: accept that they are real to the person (but not to you). • Speak quietly and firmly. 1. Use active listening practices to provide reassurance, comfort, and support. 2. Offer self-help strategies such as breathing exercises.Call Call EMS/9-1-1 immediately if you suspect that the person poses a risk to you or others, or that the person is contemplating suicide or other self- harm. If you are aware of support systems that are in place for the person, contact them as well. Self-Inflicted Injuries Self-harm ranges from minor self-inflicted injuries to suicide. Suicide is one of the ten most common causes of death in Canada, affecting people from a variety of backgrounds and age groups. Anyone expressing intentions of self-harm requires immediate intervention, and therefore EMS/9-1-1 must always be called. Possible indicators of self-harm include the following: • A person expressing negative (especially suicidal) thoughts and comments about him-or herself • A person expressing his or her intent to die, especially if he or she has a plan to do so • A person expressing his or her final wishes to someone close by (e.g., a bystander at scene) • Items associated with a suicide attempt found at the scene (e.g., a gun, sleeping pills) Childbirth You may find yourself in the position of helping a pregnant woman who is in labour. Childbirth is a natural process and the woman’s body knows what to do: Your primary role will be to provide comfort and reassurance and to facilitate the process while you wait for EMS personnel to arrive. The labour and delivery process will happen without much intervention on your part. Remember, the woman who is pregnant delivers the baby. Be patient and let the birth happen naturally.

Position the baby face down and wipe any fluids or mucus away from his or her mouth and nose. 6. Check the baby’s airway and breathing. Babies may not breathe and cry immediately after they are born. Usually, actively drying them with a towel will stimulate them to breathe and cry. If the baby does not begin to breathe or cry following stimulation, begin CPR. 7. Keep the baby warm by placing him or her directly onto the mother’s chest and covering with a blanket or towel, or by wrapping the baby in a clean towel or blanket. 8. Let the placenta and cord drop onto a clean towel and keep this near the baby. Do not cut the cord. Handle the placenta and cord as little as possible. 9. Record the time of birth. 10.

    "content": "How Body Temperature Is Controlled The human body’s core temperature (i.e., the temperature of the heart, lungs, and brain) is normally around 37°C (98.6°F) and is maintained by balancing heat loss with heat gain. The body generates heat by either converting food into energy or by contracting muscles (e.g., shivering, exercising). The heat produced by routine activities such as walking is usually enough to balance normal heat loss. The Hypothalamus and Body Temperature The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that controls thermoregulation, which is the body’s ability to maintain a temperature that is within the ideal range. The hypothalamus gets temperature information from the skin and central receptors. If the body is too warm, thermoregulatory \"heat loss\" responses include increasing the skin’s blood flow and/or sweating to facilitate evaporation. If the body is too cold, responses include decreasing the skin’s blood flow and shivering, which produces heat by contracting and relaxing muscles. Environmental Illness137.",

    "content": "The Four Mechanisms of Heating and Cooling the Body Heat moves from warmer areas to cooler ones through four mechanisms: 1. Radiation: (Warming or cooling) Involves the direct loss or absorption of heat energy through electromagnetic waves. 2. Conduction: (Warming or cooling) Occurs through direct contact with a solid or liquid. Heat loss due to direct contact with cold snow could be decreased by minimizing contact or increasing insulation (e.g., sitting on an insulated pad on the snow). 3. Convection: (Warming or cooling) Occurs when air or liquid moves across the skin. In cold air, this is known as the wind chill factor. Convective heating can also occur if warm air is blown across the 4. Evaporation: (Cooling only) Occurs when a liquid changes to a vapour. This physical process requires heat, which means that evaporation from the skin takes heat from the surface of the body. When sweat or water (either on the skin or in clothing that is in contact with the skin) evaporates, the skin is cooled. Sweating occurs when either the skin and/or body core temperatures increase. In a cold environment, sweating should be minimized (e.g., layers of clothing should be removed before or during hard work). In a hot environment, evaporative heat loss is beneficial. However, any sweat that does not evaporate will not cause cooling. For example, when humidity is high, sweat does not evaporate as efficiently and may simply drip off the body.

    "content": "Heat-Related Illnesses Hyperthermia occurs when the body’s core temperature rises above the normal range. It results when at least one of the four mechanisms that cool the body is impaired by clothing, drugs, or disease, or is overwhelmed by internal heat production and/or external heat exposure. Heat-related illnesses will get worse without treatment and can change from one level to another very quickly. Prevention One of the most important actions a person can take to prevent heat- related illnesses is to drink plenty of fluids. You should drink eight 250 mL (8 oz.) glasses of fluid a day for low-exertion, routine activities and more as exertion levels increase. It is important to rehydrate regularly during longer events. If you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated, so develop the habit of drinking fluids regularly rather than waiting for the warning signs of dehydration to appear. The following tips will also help to prevent heat-related illness: • Maintain a healthy level of cardiovascular fitness. • Prior to a major event in the heat, let the body gradually acclimatize by being exposed to 1 to 2 hours of heat exertion for at least 8 days. • Avoid being outdoors during the hottest part of the day. • Reduce the intensity of activities as it gets hotter and don’t work or exercise for too long at a time. • Take frequent breaks in a cool or shaded area to cool off. This will help the body cope with short periods of extreme heat. • Dress for the heat and for the intended activity. • Make adjustments to exertion levels and work/rest cycles on hot days (e.g., schedule football practices for cooler parts of the day). • Wear a light hat when under the sun. Wear loose-fitting light clothing that allows liquid and vapour to escape. • Choose hydrating drinks, such as water or juice, over dehydrating ones like alcohol.Environmental Physical Behavioural • Heat waves, especially if there hasn’t been one in recent years • High humidity (above 75%), which decreases the ability of sweat to evaporate• Age: Babies, children, and the elderly are less able to sweat and adjust to changes in temperature • Body size and mass: Larger bodies with more fat tissue retain heat and warm up more quickly • Clothing that prevents the loss of heat and moisture (e.g., football padding) • Chronic illness • Heart disease • Skin, hormone, or nervous system • Poor physical fitness• Working or exercising too much in hot • Not drinking enough fluids to replace the water lost by sweating (dehydration) • Drinking too much alcohol in hot weather • Taking stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines • Salt depletion • FatigueCOMMON CAUSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL ILLNESS Environmental Illness139.",

If a drink containing electrolytes is not available, have the person drink water. 3. Gently stretch and massage the cramped muscles. When the cramps stop, the person can usually resume his or her activity as long as there are no other signs or symptoms of illness.Myth-Information Myth: When a person has heat cramps, you should give salt tablets to replenish lost sodium. Salt tablets are not an effective treatment for heat cramps. Consuming a concentrated form of salt can actually promote loss of fluid from the body, which will make the person’s condition worse instead of better. Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion occurs when the body begins to overheat, especially when it loses more fluids and electrolytes through sweating than it gains through rehydration. It usually happens after long periods of strenuous activity in a hot environment, especially if it is humid or lacking in air circulation, as these conditions make it difficult for sweat to evaporate. Heat exhaustion is an early indicator that the body’s temperature- regulating mechanisms are being overwhelmed. As more blood flows to the skin to remove heat from the body’s core, not enough blood flows to the vital organs. This causes a mild form of shock. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, so monitor the person’s condition carefully. Environmental Illness140.",

    "content": "There are two levels of frostbite: Superficial frostbite occurs when the skin freezes but the underlying tissues are unaffected. It may produce clear blisters after the tissue thaws, but little or no tissue loss typically occurs. Deep frostbite occurs when tissues beneath the skin (including tendons, muscles, and blood vessels) freeze. Inside the body, ice crystals and swelling begin to damage or destroy the body’s cells, blood vessels, and nerves. Deep frostbite may produce dark, hemorrhagic blisters when the tissue thaws, and is more likely to result in tissue loss. Before frostbite occurs, a person’s skin may appear shiny and rosy (a condition sometimes called \"frost nip\"). This is a warning that frostbite is imminent. If you see these signs, advise the person to move to a warmer environment or protect his or her skin with layers of clothing. Common Causes Factors that increase the risk of frostbite include the following: • Moisture on the skin • Exposure to wind • Insufficient insulation • Clothing or equipment that reduces or constricts blood flowPrevention The following tips will help to prevent frostbite: • Never ignore numbness: If an extremity feels numb or tingly, you must take steps to warm it immediately (e.g., put your hands under your armpits or pull your arms inside your jacket for direct skin-to- skin contact). • Cover up vulnerable areas such as the cheeks, nose, and ears by wearing clothing that is appropriate for the weather (e.g., scarf, toque, mittens). • Wear mittens instead of gloves when possible, as mittens provide better insulation. • Maximize foot insulation but avoid a tight fit around the toes. • Wear clothing in layers and adjust as necessary so that you feel warm but are not overheating and sweating. • Keep well hydrated. • Keep clothing dry and change out of wet clothing as soon as What to Look For Superficial Frostbite Signs and symptoms of superficial frostbite include: • Hardened skin • Skin that looks paler than the area around it • Pain or stinging in the area, followed by numbness Deep Frostbite Signs and symptoms of deep frostbite include: • Waxy skin that is colder than the area around it • Skin and underlying tissue that is hard and solid to the touch • Skin that is white, blue, black, or mottled • Complete loss of feelingCold-Related Illness Cold-related illnesses are any conditions that are caused by exposure to colder temperatures. They range in severity from superficial frostbite to life-threatening hypothermia. Frostbite is a local, superficial injury caused by freezing of the skin and, in more extreme cases, the underlying tissues. Extremities, such as the toes, feet, fingers, hands, ears, and nose are particularly prone to frostbite. Environmental Illness145.",

Hypothermia becomes a life-threatening condition when the core temperature drops below 28°C (82.4°F). People with smaller body types, lower overall body weights, and lower body-fat content are much more likely to experience hypothermia. Hypothermia can occur at any time of year, with young children and the elderly being most at risk. Common Causes The following may lead to hypothermia: • Sweating while outdoors in cold weather • Cold, wet, windy conditions • Cold-water immersion, especially in water below 10°C (50°F) • Dehydration • Taking medications to eliminate water from the body Prevention The following tips will help to prevent hypothermia: • Prepare for activities in cold environments by wearing appropriate ¶Wear a hat and clothing made of tightly woven fibres (e.g., wool, fleece), which provide insulation and allow moisture transmission from the skin to the external environment. ¶Avoid cotton because it soaks up water and stays wet. ¶Wear clothing in layers so that they can be added or removed according to the weather conditions and exercise intensity. Remove some clothing before working to reduce the amount of sweat and keep clothing dry. • Keep clothing dry. If clothing gets wet, change into dry clothing as soon as possible. • Carry and consume high-energy foods that have a lot of sugar.• Drink plenty of warm, high-calorie drinks to help fuel heat production. If high-calorie drinks are not available, drink plenty of water to at least keep from becoming dehydrated. • Do not drink alcohol. • Take frequent breaks from the cold to let the body warm up. • Increase your activity level, add insulation, add a heat source, or get out of the cold if shivering occurs. • Be careful around cold water and always wear a personal flotation device (PFD). What to Look For Levels of Cold Stress Cold Stress (Not Hypothermic) • Shivering • Normal mental status • Able to care for self Mild Hypothermia • Vigorous shivering; complaining of the cold • Decreased physical function • Difficulty taking care of self Moderate Hypothermia • Weak and intermittent shivering or shivering that later stops • Sometimes complaining of the cold • Lack of coordination or speech; confused or unusual behaviour • Impaired judgment • Possible unresponsiveness Severe Hypothermia • Shivering has stopped • Unresponsiveness; breathing has slowed down or stopped • Body feels stiff • No pulse147147 Environmental Illness147.",

    "content": "Cold-Water Immersion Cold-water immersion can occur in open water (e.g., when a boat capsizes) or after breaking through the ice. Although hypothermia occurs faster in cold water than cold air, the signs, symptoms, and care are essentially the same. Cold-water immersion has four distinct phases: 1. Cold-Shock Response: Rapid cooling of the skin causes a gasp followed by hyperventilation (lasting 1 to 2 minutes). 2. Cold Incapacitation: Further cooling of nerve and muscle fibres causes weakness and a loss of coordination, leading to incapacitation within approximately 15 minutes. 3. Hypothermia: A person dressed appropriately for the weather conditions will take 30 minutes or more to become mildly hypothermic. 4. Circum-Rescue Collapse: Can occur just prior to, during, or after rescue. The signs and symptoms range from collapsing, to fainting, to cardiac arrest. When rescuing a person from cold water, monitor the person’s condition carefully and be prepared to provide emergency care. Most deaths in cold water result from the Cold-Shock Response (when the head is under water) or drowning due to Cold Incapacitation. A properly worn personal flotation device (PFD) will keep a person afloat after he or she loses the ability to swim during the Cold Incapacitation phase.What to Do (Rescue) Self-Rescue 1. If you are in open water, do a self-rescue by getting into a boat, raft, or other mode of marine transportation, if available. 2. If you have fallen through the ice, place your arms on the surface of the ice, kick your legs until your body is horizontal to the water’s surface, and then kick and pull forward until you are on the ice. Roll away from the hole before standing up. Survive to Await Rescue If you are in open water and self-rescue is not possible, increase your survival time by doing the following: 1. Get out of the water as much as possible by using a capsized boat or other floating object as a flotation device. 2. If you are wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), adopt the Heat Escape Lessening Position (HELP): • Press your arms against your armpits. • Place your forearms across your chest. • Squeeze your thighs together and raise your knees toward your chest. 3. If several people are together, adopt the HUDDLE position: • Face each other. • Have each person squeeze his or her thighs together. • Form a circle and hug each other. Each person should place one arm above and one arm below the arms of those adjacent, and pull the sides of the chests together. • Sandwich any children or persons without a PFD inside the HUDDLE.151151 Environmental Illness151.",

This will prevent you from drowning if the cold exposure causes incapacitation or unresponsiveness. First Aider Rescue To help rescue a person from cold water: 1. Talk – Instruct the person on self-rescue. 2. Throw – Throw a rope or buoyant object to the person. 3. Reach – Reach out to the person with a rigid object like a ladder, paddle, or tree Any person rescued from cold water should be treated for hypothermia.

Drowning is a leading cause of death for children and babies. An average of 400 Canadians drown each year. Young children aged 1 to 4 and men aged 15 to 44 are at the greatest risk.These common warning signs can indicate that someone is drowning: • The person is vertical in the water, and is not using his or her legs to move forward or tread water. • The person may have an expression of fear. • The person’s arms may be flailing up and down as he or she tries to rise out of the water to breathe, rather than trying to swim forward. • The person’s movements are uncontrolled.

    "content": "A poison is a substance that has a harmful effect within the body if it is inhaled, swallowed (ingested), absorbed, or injected. Poisons are immediately life-threatening if they affect breathing or circulation. Practically anything can be a poison if it is not meant to be taken into the body. Even some substances that are meant to be taken into the body, such as medications, can be poisonous if they are taken by the wrong person, or if the person takes too much. Combining certain substances can also result in poisoning. Poisoning can happen anywhere, but most poisonings take place in the home. Children younger than 5 years, especially toddlers, are at the highest risk for poisoning. Children may be attracted to pretty liquids in bottles, sweet-smelling powders, berries on plants that look like they are edible, or medications or vitamins that look like candy. Additionally, very young children explore their world by touching and tasting things around them, so even substances that do not look or smell attractive are poisoning hazards among this age group. Older adults who have medical conditions that cause confusion (such as dementia) or who have impaired vision are also at a higher risk of unintentional poisoning. When providing first aid for a poisoned person, use caution to avoid contact with the poison. Your local Poison Control Centre can provide you with specific first aid instructions for a variety of types of poison, but remember that you should always call EMS/9-1-1 if the person has an altered level of responsiveness or is having difficulty breathing. Keep the local Poison Control Centre number by your telephone and save it as a contact in your mobile phone.Swallowed Poison Enters the body through the mouth, lips, esophagus, or stomach. Drinking bleach is an example of swallowed poisoning. Absorbed Poison Enters the body through the skin. Plants (such as poison ivy) and chemicals can cause absorbed poisoning. Injected Poison Enters the body through bites or stings or as drugs injected with a needle. Inhaled Poison Is breathed into the body. Breathing in carbon monoxide from a car’s exhaust is an example of inhaled poisoning.TYPES OF POISONS Poisons155.",

    "content": "Prevention Prevention at Home The following tips will help reduce the risk of poisoning: • Keep all medications, household cleaning products, poisonous plants, and other toxic substances well out of the reach of children. Use locked cupboards or child-resistant latches. • Use child-resistant safety caps on medications and other potentially toxic products. • Never call medicine \"candy\" to persuade a child to take it. • Teach children to check with an adult before eating an unknown substance. • Keep potentially poisonous products in their original containers with their original labels. • Ensure that prescription medicine is taken only by the person whose name is on the label. • Carefully dispose of expired medications through your local hazardous waste process. • Be aware that many cleaning products and aerosol sprays have toxic fumes. Use potentially poisonous chemicals in a well- ventilated area. • Wear proper protective clothing any time you are working with or around a poisonous substance. • Run gas and other combustion engines only in open, well- ventilated areas. • Learn about poisonous plants in your area and before going into a new environment.Prevention in the Workplace The following tips will reduce the risk of poisoning in the workplace: • Clearly label all toxic substances and never use a product that is not clearly identified. • Have a detailed MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) available for every hazardous substance in the workplace. • Ensure that workers who might be exposed to hazardous materials receive the proper training in safety measures and emergency procedures. • Check all warning labels, tags, and posters in the workplace and follow their instructions carefully. • Read labels and the MSDS to find out the risks of each hazardous material, the safety measures that must be taken to prevent poisoning, and the first aid required if poisoning occurs. General Care for Poisoning Your check of the scene and the person might give clues that point to poisoning as the cause of the person’s illness. For example, you may note an open or spilled container, an unusual odour, burns around the person’s mouth, a strange odour on the person’s breath, or other people in the area who are also ill. If you think that a person has been poisoned, try to find out the following key points so that you and others can give the most appropriate care: • The type of poison • The quantity taken • When it was taken Poisons157.",

    "content": "Calling EMS/9-1-1 or a Poison Control Centre is the most important thing you can do if a poisoning of any type is suspected. Other general first aid care tips for poisoning include the following: • Limit further exposure by moving either the person or the source of the poison. • If the poison’s container is found nearby, give the information from the label to the Poison Control Centre or EMS/9-1-1 dispatcher. • Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless an EMS dispatcher or Poison Control Centre staff member tells you to do so. • If you do not know what the poison was and the person vomits, save a sample to give to EMS personnel. Swallowed PoisonsWhat to Do What to Look For The following may indicate that a poisonous substance has been swallowed: • An open container of poison nearby • Burns around the mouth • Increased production of saliva or saliva that is an abnormal colour • Abdominal cramps, vomiting, or diarrhea • Seizures • Dizziness or drowsiness • Unresponsiveness • A burning sensation in the mouth, throat, or stomachCall If the person is responsive and alert and his or her ABCs are unaffected, call the local Poison Control Centre. Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the person has an altered level of responsiveness or has difficulty breathing. 1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. Use a barrier device so that you don’t contaminate yourself with the poison. 2. Check the packaging of the poison, if possible, so that you know what it is. 3. Induce vomiting only if told to do so by the EMS dispatcher or the Poison Control Centre. 4. If the person needs to go to the hospital, bring a sample of the poison (or its original container). Myth-Information: Induce Vomiting in a Poisoned Person Myth: Inducing vomiting in a poisoned person will remove the harmful substance from the person’s body. Inducing vomiting in a person who has been poisoned often causes additional harm and is not recommended. Sometimes the person may vomit on his or her own, but you should never give the person anything to make him or her vomit unless you are specifically instructed to do so by an EMS dispatcher or a Poison Control Centre staff member.

    "content": "Inhaled Poisons What to Look ForCarbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that has no smell, colour, or taste. CO poisoning is often called a \"silent killer\" because it is not detectable to any of the body’s senses. CO bonds to red blood cells 200 times better than oxygen, preventing oxygen from attaching and therefore starving the body of oxygen. It releases when fuel is burned in small engines, lanterns, fireplaces, stoves, grills, gas ranges, furnaces, cars, and trucks. When equipment that burns these fuels is properly ventilated, CO poisoning is not a problem. But if the equipment or ventilation system is faulty, or if outdoor equipment is used in an enclosed area, toxic levels of CO can build up quickly, creating the risk of CO poisoning. Concentrated CO is poisonous and life-threatening to those who inhale it. Prevention The following tips help prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning: • Ensure that a battery-operated or battery back-up CO detector is installed in the home or workplace where the alarm will be easily • Check the CO detector’s batteries twice a year, ideally once in the fall and once in the spring. • Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment installed and repaired by a qualified technician. • Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment serviced annually by a qualified professional. • Use fuel-based appliances and materials as intended (e.g., do not use generators or portable flameless chemical heaters indoors, do not use a gas stove or oven for heating, do not burn charcoal indoors). • Ensure that chimneys are inspected and cleaned annually by a professional. • Never run a car or truck inside an attached garage. For detached garages, always leave the garage door open when running a car or truck inside. The following may indicate that a poisonous substance has been inhaled: • Breathing difficulties • Irritated eyes, nose, or throat • Dizziness • Vomiting • Seizures • Bluish colour around the mouth • Unresponsiveness • An unusual smell in the air What to Do If the person is responsive and alert and his or her ABCs are unaffected, call the local Poison Control Centre. Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the person has an altered level of responsiveness or has difficulty breathing. 1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. Use a barrier device so that you don’t contaminate yourself with the poison. 2. Get the person into fresh air but do not enter into a hazardous atmosphere in order to do so. Inhaled poisons can affect everyone in an area. Stay out of the area if you suspect that the poison may still be in the air. Poisons159.",

    "content": "Rash-Causing Plants Some plants produce chemicals that can cause absorbed poisoning on contact. These plants vary in appearance depending on the location, species of the plant, and time of year. As prevention is the best strategy, it is a good idea to become familiar with the appearance of rash-causing plants in your area. Prevention When there is the potential for exposure to rash-causing plants, follow these guidelines: • Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed-toed shoes. • Apply a pre-contact barrier cream or lotion before going outside. • Wash skin with a specialized skin cleanser designed to remove plant oils or a degreasing soap (such as dishwashing liquid) and plenty of water immediately after returning indoors. • Wash tools, work gloves, and clothing that may have contacted rash- causing plants, as oils can remain on these items and transfer to the skin the next time they are used. If you suspect that your skin has come into contact with a rash-causing plant, wash the entire area with a degreasing soap immediately. Poison Ivy, Sumac, and Oak Plants such as poison ivy, poison sumac, and poison oak are covered with an oil called urushiol, which causes a skin reaction in most people. What to Look For Contact with urushiol can cause the following signs and symptoms: • Itchy skin • Reddening of the skin • Blisters The rash can range from irritating to unbearable, depending on the person’s sensitivity, the amount of skin exposed, and the rash’s location. Do not burn plants containing urushiol. The oil is carried in the smoke, and inhalation can cause swelling of the throat and irritation of the lungs. What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 only if the person experiences a severe allergic reaction or is having trouble breathing. 1. Encourage the person to apply a cream or ointment designed to reduce itching and blistering (e.g., calamine). 2. Suggest that the person take an oral antihistamine to help relieve itching. 3. If the rash is severe or on a sensitive part of the body (such as the face or groin), the person should see a healthcare provider. Poisons161.",

Signs and symptoms will vary depending on the drug.What to Look For Stimulants • Stimulants affect the brain and nerves to speed up physical and mental activity. • Many stimulants are swallowed as pills, but some can be absorbed or Hallucinogens • Hallucinogens cause changes in mood, sensation, thought, emotion, and self-awareness. • They can cause intense fear, panic, paranoid delusions, vivid hallucinations, deep depression, tension, and anxiety. Depressants • Depressants send signals to the brain and nerves that slow down physical and mental activity. • They cause drowsiness and impair coordination and judgment. • Alcohol is the most widely used and abused depressant in Canada. Designer Drugs • Designer drugs don’t fit into any of the categories mentioned above. • They are often chemically altered versions of medical drugs, such as narcotics and amphetamines. • Their effects can be unpredictable and dangerous. • Ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, and LSD are examples of designer drugs.The signs and symptoms of drug poisoning will vary depending on the drug but often include the following: • Moist or flushed skin • Sweating • Chills or fever • Nausea or vomiting • Vomiting blood or passing blood • Changes in breathing or difficulty breathing • Racing or pounding heart • Continuous pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen • Seizures • Severe headache • Slurred speech • Changes in level of responsiveness • Changes in behaviour (e.g., aggression or fear) What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if you suspect a drug overdose or if the person is having seizures, has difficulty breathing, is unresponsive, or has a change in behaviour. 1.

    "content": "Opioid Overdose Opioid drugs, such as heroin, oxycodone, and fentanyl, are a common cause of drug overdose in Canada. Many prescription drugs are or contain opiates. EMS personnel use naloxone (Narcan®) to reverse the effects of opioid drugs. In some provinces, First Aiders, first responders, and people in high-risk addiction situations can receive training in administering naloxone. Naloxone can be supplied as a nasal spray or an injectable solution. Naloxone and Opioid Drug Overdoses Naloxone is used to quickly reverse the effects of an opioid drug overdose, specifically counteracting central nervous system depression and respiratory depression. Signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose include the following: • Slowed breathing (or no breathing) • Chest tightness • Extreme drowsiness or unresponsiveness • Small pupils1. If the person is unresponsive and not breathing, begin CPR. Do not delay CPR treatment to give the person naloxone. 2. If the person is unresponsive but is breathing, and if you have received training in its use, give the person naloxone by following the instructions on the label. Always follow specific policies and the training you have received in providing 3. Stay with the person and provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive. Ensure that the person receives professional medical care, as naloxone alone is not enough to care for a person who has overdosed on opioids. Administering naloxone requires special training. If you are trained and naloxone is available, you can give naloxone to someone suffering from an opioid drug overdose, as this is an effective and lifesaving treatment. What to Look For What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.Care Alcohol Poisoning Alcohol is a depressant that affects the central nervous system. It impairs judgment, slows down reflexes, and makes driving unsafe. Very high levels of alcohol in the bloodstream can affect the brain’s ability to control the body’s breathing, heart rate, and temperature, which can lead to death. Alcohol poisoning occurs when large quantities of alcohol are consumed in a short period of time, resulting in toxic levels of alcohol in the body. There are many factors that can contribute to an unsafe blood alcohol • Speed of drinking • Full or empty stomach • Type of alcohol • The person’s weight and sex Poisons165.",

    "content": "Rabies is a serious infection that attacks the brain and spinal cord. It is fatal if it is not treated. The virus that causes rabies is spread when an animal that has the disease bites another animal or a person. Wild animals (such as foxes, skunks, bats, and raccoons) can carry rabies, as can pets and livestock that have not been vaccinated against it. Only mammals can be infected with rabies. Animals with rabies may act strangely. For example, an animal that is usually active at night may appear in the daytime, or a normally shy wild animal might not run away when people approach. Rabid animals may drool, appear to be partially paralyzed, or be aggressive or strangely quiet. Call EMS/9-1-1 if a person is bitten by an animal that you suspect might have rabies. If possible, try to remember details about the animal’s behaviour and appearance, and where you last saw it. When you call EMS/9-1-1, the dispatcher will direct the proper authorities (e.g., animal control) to the scene. A person who is bitten by an animal that might have rabies must get medical attention immediately. Treatment for rabies includes a series of injections to build up immunity that will help fight the disease. Insect Stings Most of the time, insect stings are merely uncomfortable. However, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are always a concern. Some insects, such as bees, leave their stingers embedded in the person’s skin. Others, such as wasps, can sting multiple times, but leave no stinger behind. 5. Seek medical attention if the animal is wild, stray, or unknown to you, or if you suspect the animal might have rabies. 6. Watch for signs and symptoms of infection and ensure that the person continues to monitor the wound over the next several The following can indicate an insect sting, especially if you see insects nearby: • Quick, sharp pain at the site of the sting • Pain, redness, or swelling at the site of the sting • A stinger embedded in the skinPrevention To reduce the risk of insect stings: • Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed-toe shoes. • Don’t wear perfume, cologne, or other products with strong scents. • Remove or cover items that will attract insects, such as garbage or What to Look For What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if there are any signs of a severe allergic Poisons167.",

Pull upward slowly and steadily without twisting until the tick releases its hold. If you cannot remove the tick or if its mouthparts stay in the skin, the person should seek medical attention.If the tick hasn’t started to dig into the flesh, remove it by brushing it off If the tick has begun to bite: 3. If the tick is removed, wash the area with clean tap water. The pressure of the running water lets it penetrate more deeply into the wound. 4. If possible, save the tick in a resealable bag and record the date of the bite. 5. Advise the person to monitor the bite for several days for signs and symptoms of infection. If the area becomes infected (i.e., it becomes red, warm, or painful), or the person develops a fever, he or she should seek medical attention. Myth-Information: Properly Removing a Tick Myth: You can remove a tick safely by burning it off with a flame or smothering it with petroleum jelly or nail polish. These folk remedies are not the most effective methods. They rely on the tick detaching itself, which could take hours. As long as the tick’s mouthparts are in contact with the skin, the tick is potentially transmitting disease. The goal is to remove the tick in one piece as quickly as possible. The best tool for doing this is a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or a special tick removal tool, such as a tick key. Lyme Disease Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that are transmitted to humans through bites from infected ticks. If Lyme disease is not treated, it can become a chronic condition with serious symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, joint and muscle pain, and neurological disorders.Ticks can be infected with more than one type of bacteria that can cause human illness. Signs can appear weeks to months after a bite. If a person feels unwell after a tick bite, he or she should seek medical attention. Poisons169.",

These rashes are typically 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) across. Other signs and symptoms of Lyme disease include: • Headache • Fever or chills • Swollen lymph nodes • Numbness or tingling • Muscle spasms or weakness • Joint and muscle pain (similar in feeling to the flu) What to Do Seek medical attention as soon as possible. If possible, save the tick responsible for the bite in a resealable bag or empty pill bottle, and bring it to the medical appointment. It may help the doctor diagnose the illness.Snakebites In the wild, snakes like to occupy rock outcrops, swamps, undergrowth, and abandoned human structures. When disturbed, some snakes can inject venom as they bite. The vast majority of Canada’s snakes are non-venomous, but there are three venomous snakes currently native to Canada. All three are rattlesnakes: 1. Northern Pacific Rattlesnake 2. Massasauga Rattlesnake 3. Prairie Rattlesnake If you hear a rattlesnake, remain still until the snake is located, then back away slowly: avoid stomping or jumping as this may startle the snake. Other venomous snakes in North America include copperheads, cottonmouths (water moccasins), and coral snakes. Most deaths from venomous snakebites occur because: • Too much time passed before the person received medical care. • The person had an allergic reaction to the venom. • The snake bite compounded an existing health condition in the Prevention The following steps will help prevent snakebites: • Do not aggravate a snake. • Wear proper footwear and watch where you put your feet when Poisons170.",

    "content": "Myth-Information Myth: You can help to slow the spread of venom through the body by cutting the wound or applying suction, ice, electricity, or a tourniquet. These measures are not effective for slowing the spread of venom. In fact, they are likely to cause pain and injury. Your time is better spent seeking medical attention as quickly as possible. Spider Bites Very few spiders in Canada can cause serious illness or death. The bites of harmless spiders often cause reactions similar to those of bee stings (e.g., swelling, redness, and stinging or pain at the site). However, two types of venomous spiders are occasionally encountered in Canada: the brown recluse and the black widow. The bite of either spider can, in rare cases, be life-threatening. Black Widow Spiders The black widow spider is black with a reddish hourglass shape on the underside of its body. Its bite is the most painful and deadly of all the widow spiders, especially for very young children and older adults. The bite usually causes an immediate, sharp, \"pin-prick\" pain, followed by dull pain in the area of the bite. However, the person often does not know that he or she has been bitten until he or she starts to feel ill or notices a bite mark or swelling. The signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bite (e.g., abdominal cramps), can mimic those of other medical emergencies. Anyone with a suspected bite should be seen by a doctor for correct diagnosis and treatment.Brown Recluse Spiders The brown recluse spider has a distinctive violin-shaped pattern on the back of its front body section. At first, the bite may produce little or no pain. Pain in the area of the bite develops an hour or more later. A blood-filled blister forms under the surface of the skin, sometimes in a target or bull’s- eye pattern. Over several hours, the blister increases in size and eventually ruptures, leading to tissue destruction and a black scab. What to Look For Signs and symptoms of spider bites depend on the amount of venom injected and the person’s sensitivity to the venom. Most spider bites heal with no adverse effects or scarring. Signs and symptoms of venomous spider bites can seem identical to those of other conditions and therefore can be difficult to recognize. The only way for a First Aider to be certain that a venomous spider has bitten a person is to have witnessed it. Black Widow Spider Bite Signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bite include the following: • A raised, round, red mark • Cramping pain in the thighs, shoulders, back, and abdominal • Restlessness and anxiety • Dizziness • Headache • Excessive sweating • Weakness172172 Poisons172.",

If hot water is not available, use dry hot packs, or, as a second choice, dry cold packs to help decrease the pain. Remember to wrap the hot or cold packs in a thin, dry towel or cloth to protect the skin. Do not rub the area or apply a bandage. If the person has been stung by a Portuguese man-of-war (also called a bluebottle jellyfish), flush the injured areas with ocean water instead of vinegar. Do not flush any jellyfish sting with fresh water, ammonia, or rubbing alcohol because these substances can increase the person’s pain.To care for a person who has been stung by a stingray, sea urchin, or spiny fish: 1. Get the person out of the water as soon as possible. 2. Flush the affected area with tap water. Ocean water may also 3.

SkinDoes the child have: • Hot and dry skin or cold and moist skin? • A rash or spots? • An unusual skin colour? • Itchy skin? • Any bruising or swelling?Caring for children, either at home or in a child care setting, involves special considerations. Children often have a higher risk of complications from illnesses and there are certain diseases that children are more susceptible to. Young children, especially, may not yet be vaccinated against diseases that most adults are immunized against. In general, children’s immune systems are less developed and less able to resist infection. Infections can spread quickly between children, as they don’t always follow proper hygiene procedures (such as blowing their noses and washing their hands). Child care settings have special notification and disinfection procedures, so ensure that you are aware of the protocols that apply to your workplace and follow them carefully. Protecting Children from Infection In a child care setting, protect children from infectious diseases by: • Insisting that staff members who are sick not come in to work. • Encouraging parents and guardians to keep sick children at home. • Having an isolation room for children who unexpectedly become ill. • Washing your hands before and after contact with a child who has diarrhea or is vomiting. • Washing bedding and equipment at least once a week, or every day when children are sick. • Teaching children the importance of covering their mouths (preferably with the inside of their elbow) when they cough or sneeze and washing their hands afterward. In a child care setting, follow these guidelines for cleaning the bathroom: • Clean and sanitize the bathroom sink, countertop, toilet, and floor with a bleach solution once a day. • If you use the bathroom sink to clean toilet trainers, use a bleach solution to sanitize the sink afterward.Questions to Ask Yourself If You Think a Child May Be Ill It can be more difficult to identify illness in a child than in an adult, because children may not be as good at communicating what is wrong. If you suspect that a child may be ill, ask yourself the questions in the following table. If you answer \"yes\" to any, it may be a sign of illness. Childhood Illnesses176.",

For minor issues, such as a small cut, a change in behaviour (e.g., not playing as usual), or a change in appetite, you should inform the parent or guardian when he or she picks the child up. Common Childhood Conditions: Guidelines for Care Some childhood illnesses and conditions are contagious. Some conditions cause irritation and discomfort, while others can cause lifelong complications or even death. Preventative practices include proper hygiene (including routine hand washing) and limiting exposure to people who are ill. Babies who are 6 months or older are the most vulnerable to these diseases. Vaccination is also a fundamental preventive strategy. Vaccines have been incredibly effective in preventing childhood diseases and decreasing child mortality rates. Common childhood vaccines include diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella. Provincial/territorial legislation dictates which contagious diseases must be reported to the local health unit. For some contagious diseases, parents and guardians have a responsibility to ensure that the child care facility or school is informed, in addition to the local health unit. Childhood Illnesses178.",

Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection that causes severe inflammation of the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue above the vocal cords that protects the airway during swallowing. When it becomes infected, it can swell until the airway is completely obstructed. A child with epiglottitis may: • Appear severely ill and have a high fever. • Need to be sitting up. • Strain to breathe. • Appear to be very frightened. • Drool from the mouth, as swelling may prevent swallowing.Croup is a respiratory condition, usually triggered by an acute viral infection of the upper airways. The infection causes swelling of the throat and of the tissues below the vocal cords. Croup is generally non-life-threatening, but it can lead to severe shortness of breath and hypoxia. Croup is commonly identified by its distinctive harsh, barking cough, often described as being like the bark of a seal. Croup is often preceded by 1 or 2 days of illness, sometimes with a fever. Croup occurs more often in the winter months and the signs and symptoms of croup are often more evident in the evening. The child may show improvement when exposed to cool air.

A child may be very sick and not have a fever, or may be running a fever and playing happily. The best way to gauge the severity of an illness is to note changes in the child’s behaviour. Taking a Child’s Temperature Normal body temperature is 37°C (98.6°F). Anything higher than this is considered a fever. To determine a child’s temperature you must use a thermometer. Many types of digital thermometers are available, including those intended for use in the mouth and ear. Follow these general principles when taking a child’s temperature, along with any specific manufacturer’s instructions for your thermometer. Do not take the temperature rectally as this can damage the bowel lining.What to Do 1. Wash your hands thoroughly. 2. If taking the temperature orally, make sure that the child has not had anything hot or cold to eat or drink in the previous 10 3. Clean and reset the thermometer as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. 4. Place the thermometer in the child’s mouth (under the tongue) or in the child’s ear. 5. Leave the thermometer in place until it beeps, or for up to 1 minute (if your model does not have an audio notification). 6. If you are using a thermometer for more than one child (e.g., in a child care setting), use protective covers and throw them away after every use. 7. Record the temperature, the time, and the method of taking the child’s temperature (e.g., \"oral\"). 8. Clean the thermometer after every use as instructed by the manufacturer.

If a child is being given non-prescription medication, ensure you have written permission from a parent or guardian for each medication that is to be given. Parents or guardians should give the first dose of a new medication so that they can watch for any unusual signs, symptoms, reactions, or behaviours in their children or babies.1. Children with fevers should be dressed lightly because they may feel warm. If they get too cold or start to shiver, cover them until the skin feels warm when you touch it. 2. Sponge the child with room temperature water. 3. Give the child plenty of fluids to ensure that he or she stays 4. If the fever rises above 39°C (102°F) or persists for more than 3 days, seek medical attention. 5. Give fever-reducing medications, as discussed with the healthcare practitioner. Complications Related to Fever Reye’s Syndrome A child or teenager with a viral infection, such as chickenpox or influenza, may develop Reye’s syndrome if given ASA (e.g., Aspirin®). Reye’s syndrome is a disease of the brain and liver that can lead to death. Never give ASA to a child or teenager with a viral infection without first consulting a healthcare practitioner. A child or baby may suffer a seizure during a high fever. If this occurs, follow the care steps for febrile seizures. Childhood Illnesses189.",

    "content": "General Rules for Medication To reduce the risk of miscommunication and error, it is a good idea to have just one person in the child care setting who is responsible for giving all medications. Store all medication out of the reach of children.Some provinces and territories have legislation regarding medication administration in child care settings. Always follow local protocols. When giving medication: • Wash your hands thoroughly. • Check the medication three times: ¶When you take the medication out from the cupboard or refrigerator ¶When you take the medication out of the package ¶Just before you administer the medication • Keep a written record of the date and time the medication was given, the name of the child, the name of the medication, the person who gave the medication, and the amount given. Record all this information when you give the medication. • Call the parent or guardian if the child cannot keep the medication • Report to the parent, guardian, or doctor any reactions or effects not usually experienced by the child. • At the end of each day, tell the parent or guardian what medication was given and at what time. • Follow any specific directions for the medication (e.g., \"do not take with food\"). • When applying topical medication, protect yourself by using an applicator or by wearing disposable gloves. • Emergency medicine, such as inhalers or epinephrine auto-injectors, should be accessible at all times but out of the reach of children.How to Give Specific Medications Medication in the Eye 1. Have the child look up while in a lying or sitting position. 2. Gently pull down the lower eyelid. 3. Hold the dropper horizontally about one inch out from the child’s eye. 4. Drop the medication into the little pocket between the lower lid and the eyeball. 5. Ask the child to close the eye then briefly hold a cotton ball against the inside corner of the eye. Use a separate cotton ball for each eye. 6. Wipe away any excess medication. Medication in the Nose 1. Have the child lie on a flat surface with his or her head hanging over one edge. If the child must sit up, have the child tilt his or her head back as far as possible. 2. Place the exact number of drops indicated in the prescription into each nostril. 3. Have the child remain with his or her head back for a few minutes. Childhood Illnesses190.",

    "content": "Caring for Children15.\n\nChildren are very vulnerable. Their bodies are more susceptible to injury, and they are typically less aware of risks and hazards in their environments. When caring for children, prevention, preparation, and constant supervision are critical to preventing injury. Toy and Equipment Safety Products designed for children have many features to keep them safe, but these products must be selected and used properly. You should always discard broken equipment and toys immediately, and always follow the manufacturer’s directions for safe use. When considering second-hand equipment or toys, first check the label and contact Health Canada to find out if there has been a recall or safety alert on that specific model. Equipment for Babies Safe Use of Cribs • Cribs manufactured before September 1986 do not meet current safety standards and should be disassembled and either thrown away or taken to your local recycling centre. • Manufacturers of cribs are required to include a label showing the date of manufacture. If there is no label, assume that the crib is not safe to use. • Allow only one small toy inside the crib and remove all mobiles or activity centres as soon as the baby can pull him- or herself up. • Place the crib well away from potential hazards such as blind cords, windows, pictures, and shelves. • When a child shows signs of trying to climb out of a crib, it is time to move the child to a bed or mattress on the floor. • Keep the wheels on a crib locked whenever it is in use. • Make sure that the crib slats are no more than 6 cm (2 3/8 in.) apart.• Make sure that the corner posts extend no more than 3 cm (1 1/4 in.) above the headboard and footboard. • The height from the mattress support to the top rail must be at least 66 cm (26 in.) when the support is in its lowest position. • Make sure the mattress fits snugly inside the crib. Use only mattresses sold for use in cribs. Any other substitutes, such as foam pads, may allow for pockets or spaces in which a child may get stuck or be smothered. Safe Use of Playpens • Manufacturers of playpens are required to include a Canadian Standards Association (CSA) label showing that the playpen has been approved by CSA. The label also shows the playpen’s date of manufacture. Any playpen manufactured before 1985 has not been approved by the CSA. If there is no label, assume that the playpen is not safe to use. • If a child shows signs of trying to climb out of a playpen, the playpen is no longer safe for that child. • Ensure that the playpen’s wheels are locked whenever it is in use. • Make sure that playpen walls are sturdy and at least 48 cm (19 in.) • Inspect the playpen regularly to ensure that there are no hazards such as rips or exposed sharp edges. Safe Use of High Chairs • Do not allow older children to climb on the chair, even when it is unoccupied. • A safe chair is stable and has a wide base to reduce the risk of tipping. • The harness should consist of a strap that fits between the child’s legs and a waist belt that is easy to fasten and is in good condition.

Safe Use of Baby Strollers • Manufacturers of baby strollers are required to include a Canadian Standards Association (CSA) label showing that the baby stroller has been approved by CSA. The label also shows the stroller’s date of manufacture. Any stroller manufactured before 1985 has not been approved by the CSA. If there is no label, assume that the stroller is not safe to use. • Do not load heavy parcels on the back or on the handles of the baby stroller. These could cause the stroller to tip backward. • Use a stroller with safety straps that go around the child’s waist and between the legs. • Keep children’s fingers away from moving parts. Safe Use of Pacifiers • When purchasing a pacifier, make sure it is from a reputable manufacturer. • Check pacifiers regularly for wear and tear. Discard them immediately if there is any sign of deterioration, such as discolouration, hardening, or cracking of the nipple. • If a doctor diagnoses a child or baby with a yeast infection of the mouth, immediately discard any pacifier the baby is using. Give the baby a new one only after the infection has cleared. • Use a pacifier clip, as opposed to a cord, to secure the pacifier to the child. • A teething ring should be used instead of a pacifier once the baby’s teeth start to appear.Equipment for Children Safe Use of Child Bike Trailers • Child bike trailers are recommended over child bike carriers because they reduce the risk of falls, do not cause as many steering and balance problems, and increase protection from the weather. They are also farther from the bicycle wheels, ensuring that the child cannot reach the spokes. • If possible, choose a bike trailer that has a five-point harness and • Attach a tall, bright flag to the trailer. • Connect the trailer with a flexible joint so that it will not tip over, even if the bike does. • As a bike trailer is wider than a bike, ensure that the wheels do not go over the road edge. • Ride in low-traffic areas. • Ensure that children wear Canadian Standards Association (CSA) approved and properly fitting helmets. Safe Use of Safety Gates • Use only approved safety gates. Avoid makeshift alternatives, such as pieces of furniture. • Manufacturers of safety gates are required to include a label showing the date of manufacture. If there is no label, assume that it is not safe to use. • If you can fit a pop can between the railings, a child could get stuck and the gate is not safe. • Install safety gates wherever stairs are exposed (at the top and bottom of the staircase). Make sure they are properly fitted and • If the gate has a pressure bar, make sure it is on the side away from Caring for Children193.",

It also models unsafe behaviour to • Safety gates are not a substitute for constant supervision. Always monitor children closely, even if a safety gate is in place. Toys for Children and Babies The following are guidelines to keep children safe when playing with toys: • Follow the manufacturer’s directions for safe use, including suggested age level. • Choose toys that are appropriate for the children who will be using them. The Canadian Toy Testing Council issues a list of guidelines for choosing toys. • Toys must be cleaned daily in child care centres. To clean toys and equipment, use a solution of 6 mL (1 tsp.) of bleach to 400 mL (1¾ cups) of water. Label the bottle and make a fresh solution every day. • When there are older children in the same space, their toys may have smaller parts: These toys should be separated and stored out of common play areas. • Avoid toys with sharp edges. • Paints, crayons, and markers must be completely washable and non- • Ensure that toys (and all of their detachable pieces) are too big to fit into the baby’s or child’s mouth, ears, or nose. • Provide only toys without strings because strings may cause strangulation. • Inspect toys regularly. Discard any pieces that are loose. If the toy seems unsafe, discard it immediately. • Wooden toys should be glued or screwed together instead of nailed. • Ride-around or ride-on toys must be selected according to the size of the child. • Children should wear all safety equipment that is recommended for the activity. “Toy” protective gear (e.g., plastic helmets) is for imaginative play only.• Electrical toys must bear the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) • Choose costumes that are made of flame-retardant materials. Use face paints instead of face masks to avoid blocking vision. • Large toy boxes and other containers must have air holes and self- supporting hinges if they have lids. This is necessary in case children decide to hide inside. Playground Safety Playgrounds are the site of many serious injuries, mainly falls. Some playground equipment can be unsafe or inappropriate for certain age groups. The following points help to keep children safe on the playground: • Examine park and school playgrounds for hazards such as broken glass or exposed sharp edges. • Ensure that children use playground equipment as intended (e.g., ensure that they do not climb on the outside of a tubular slide). • Ensure that there are enough adults present to watch all children carefully. • If you see unsafe or broken equipment in a playground, report this to the managing agency (e.g., community centre, park board, school • If you are installing or maintaining playground equipment, consider the age and size of the children who will be using it, and follow the manufacturer’s directions. • Ideally, sandboxes should be fitted with a cover to keep dogs, cats, and other animals from using it as a litter box.

Follow the guidelines on the safe use of car seats and the passenger rules for children to help ensure children’s safety in and around motor vehicles. Safe Use of Car Seats The law requires that all children use appropriate and approved child- restraint systems, such as child or baby seats and booster seats. These must have a label stating that they conform to the Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS), administered by Transport Canada. Use caution when buying or using a pre-owned child car seat. Buy the seat from someone you know, and check it carefully. Make sure the car • Instructions and all necessary hardware • Not been in a collision • A CMVSS sticker and is less than 10 years old • No discoloured (stress) marks or cracks • No signs of wear or tears on the harness Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and use. When driving with children who do not require a car seat, remember: • Children under the age of 13 should ride in the back seat. • If you absolutely must put a child in the front seat of a car that has an airbag, push the seat back as far as it will go. Make sure that any child who is no longer in a car seat is secured with a seat belt. Show the child how to wear the belt. The lap belt should be low across the hips, and the shoulder belt should be over the shoulder and across the chest. If the seat belt does not fit properly, a booster seat should be used.It is against the law to leave a child or baby alone in a car, even for a short time. Passenger Rules for Children: Safety Education Teach children the following rules for safety in and around motor vehicles: • Always enter and exit the car on the curb side. • Remain seated with your seat belt on while the car is moving. Stay that way until the driver has reached your destination and the car is completely turned off or the driver tells you it is safe to remove your seat belt. • Remember that the driver needs to be able to concentrate on driving, so minimize distractions inside the car. • Keep your head, arms, and feet in the car at all times. • Remember that the car’s controls are for the driver only. They are not for playing with, even when the car is parked. As a caregiver, ensure that everyone’s fingers, hands, and feet are clear of doors before the doors are closed.

    "content": "Safe Use of Wheeled Equipment Choosing a Safe Bicycle When choosing a bicycle for a child, ensure that it is the proper size:Choosing a Safe Helmet Mishaps during sports that require a helmet are the leading cause of head injuries for children in Canada. Wearing helmets can reduce the risk of a serious or fatal head injury by up to 80%. Keep the following points in mind when choosing a helmet for a child: • Use helmets approved by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Snell Memorial Foundation, or American National Standards Institute (ANSI). • A helmet should fit squarely on the child’s head and have a snug chin strap. If a helmet is involved in a fall, buy another one. Even if no damage is visible, the helmet may have lost some of its ability to absorb shock. As a role model and for safety reasons, adults should always wear a helmet while riding a bicycle. Safe Use of Bicycles Ensure that children follow these rules when using a bicycle: • Walk bicycles across roads only at intersections and pedestrian crosswalks. • Before you cross, make sure that traffic crossing your path is fully stopped at stop signs or traffic signals. • Ride in a straight line when you go down a road or street. Do not swerve between parked cars or onto driveways. Always look and signal in plenty of time before turning. • Wear bright clothes even during the day. When motorists can see a cyclist, it is easier for them to co-operate with the cyclist. • Do not ride a bicycle after dark.Local legislation may dictate what needs to be on your bike for safety (e.g., bike lights).1. Have the child stand over the bicycle seat with both feet flat on the ground. 2. Lift the bicycle up to the child’s body (both tires off the floor). There should be at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) between the tires and the floor. Adjust the height of the seat as needed. While on the seat, the child should be able to put the balls of his or her feet on the ground. Regularly check the following for any bicycle used by a child: • The brakes must work properly, and the child must be able to use them safely. • The tires must be fully inflated. • The wheels must be tightly secured and truly round. • The chain must be oiled and tight. • The spokes must be tight, straight, and unbroken. • The seat post and handlebars must be securely attached. • The bike must have a working bell or horn. • The bicycle must pass the \"bounce test:\" Bounce the bicycle up and down on its wheels on a paved surface and listen for shakes and rattles.

This will make the children more visible and reduce the risk of collisions.Fire Safety Reducing Risk of Fires and Burns The following tips can reduce the risk of fires and burns: • Keep children away from heat sources and appliances such as cooking ovens, barbecues, space heaters, wood stoves, and fireplaces. • Make sure all fireplaces and wood stoves are cleaned and inspected regularly to follow safety codes. • Keep space heaters at least 1 metre (3 ft.) away from flammable objects such as curtains and furniture. • Turn pot handles in toward the centre of the stove. • Keep cooking areas free of clutter. This will reduce the risk of igniting pot holders, aprons, and other kitchen items. • Snuff out candles immediately after use. • Keep all hot drinks out of children’s reach. • For nightwear, use only clothing designated as sleepwear. Other materials are sometimes more flammable. The government sets guidelines as to what is classified as sleepwear. • Contact your local fire department for information on inspecting your home or workplace (including child care settings) for fire hazards and reviewing your fire escape plan. • Make sure that smoke detectors are placed in all areas required by your local fire department or whichever agency regulates fire safety in your area. Change the batteries in all smoke detectors twice a year. • Keep bedroom and sleeping-area doors closed when children are sleeping. Doors are important barriers to smoke. • Make sure that all breakers and fuses on the electrical panel in your home, workplace, or child care setting are clearly labelled. • Use only single-cord plugs, as multiple-cord or octopus plugs may overheat. Keep loose cords secured and out of the way to prevent tripping and to keep children from pulling them out. • Keep an approved, all-purpose chemical fire extinguisher in the kitchen.Even the safest cyclist must watch for drivers who aren’t paying attention! It is important to teach children balancing, turning, hand signalling, and stopping on a bicycle before they go out riding. Practice these skills in the yard, a school yard, a park, or other low-traffic area. Caring for Children197.",

This exit can be used if fire blocks the Identify a location where everyone will meet if they must escape from a fire. Decide who will assist those who cannot get themselves out, such as young children or people with difficulty walking. In professional settings, legislation may determine how often this escape plan must be practiced. What to Do in the Case of Fire During the NightIce Safety Safe Skating or Walking on Ice Teach children these safety rules for skating or walking on ice: • Ice must be a minimum of 15 cm (6 in.) thick before it can support one person. Ice must be solid, clear blue, and not covered with snow. • Always skate with a buddy. • If you cannot be sure how thick a section of ice is, do not walk or skate on it. Ensure that children know what to do if they fall through the ice: • In shallow water, feel for the bottom with your feet. Then walk toward the shore or bank, breaking ice as you go. Keep going until you can slide up onto thicker ice. • In deep water, flutter-kick your feet and extend your hands forward along the ice until you can slide up onto it. Slowly crawl to safety. • After you are out of danger, get to shelter and change into warm clothing. This will help prevent hypothermia. Water Safety General Tips for the Prevention of Drowning • Pay constant attention to babies or children when they are in, on, or around water. • Turn wading pools upside down when not in use. • Empty buckets of water immediately after use. • Keep toilet lids down and keep the bathroom door closed.1. When you hear the smoke detector, roll out of bed and onto the floor. Shout “Fire, fire, fire!” Be sure to shout it 3 times. Shout “Get out and stay out!” Teach children to do this as well. 2. Crawl to the door and touch it. If it is warm, do not open it. Unlock the door so that the firefighters can open it. Seal off any cracks with blankets or towels. Wet the blankets or towels if possible. 3. Escape via the emergency exit. • If you cannot get out, take refuge in a room with a window. Open it for ventilation. Hang a sheet out the window as a signal for help. 4. Join everyone at the special meeting spot. 5. After everyone is together, go to a neighbour’s home to call the fire department. 6. Meet the fire trucks and tell the firefighters that everyone has escaped the burning building. Caring for Children198.",

    "content": "Safe Use of Bathtubs • Always be present when a child or baby is in a bathtub or bathing basin. Drowning can occur even in a few centimetres of water. • Check bathwater temperature by splashing water on your inner wrist. If it feels too hot or cold to you, do not place the child or baby in the bath until you have adjusted the temperature. • If your bathtub is a Jacuzzi-type or is equipped with water jets, do not turn these on with the child or baby in the tub. • Turn off all water taps tightly. • Place a non-slip mat in the bathtub. Safe Use of Backyard Pools and Hot Tubs • Keep children under constant supervision when they are playing in or around a backyard pool or hot tub. • Make sure basic lifesaving equipment is available at all times. Examples of basic lifesaving equipment are: (1) a strong, lightweight pole with blunt ends; and (2) a ring buoy with a long throwing rope. Be aware of equipment requirements outlined in the legislation that applies to your situation. • Cover hot tubs securely and lock them when they are not in use. • Keep decks around the pool or hot tub clean and free of debris. • Pay close attention to the surface of a diving board. Make sure the slip-resistant surface is always in good repair. Ensure that the water is deep in the entire area that divers use (mark the slope of the pool to avoid hitting the upslope). • Install a rope with buoyant markers across the pool where the deep end slope begins. • Use only unbreakable cups, dishes, and other utensils at the poolside. • Keep electrical appliances away from backyard pools. • Remove all floating toys and store them in a secure area when pool time is over.• Make sure electrical equipment used to operate the pool or hot tub conforms to electrical code requirements. • Have a phone available on the pool deck. Post a list of emergency numbers beside it. • Ensure that an outdoor pool is surrounded by a fence or wall that children cannot get through or over. Gates should have self-closing latches above the reach of toddlers. They should also include hardware for permanent locking. Obey the fencing requirements of your local municipality. • Make sure all pool chemicals are stored in a secure area. Safe Swimming • Make sure that children and adults learn to swim. For swimming lessons, take a Red Cross Swim course. • Ensure children are always supervised by a responsible adult. • Establish sensible safety rules before children do any swimming. Enforce these rules consistently and firmly. • Supervise even strong swimmers at all times. Sudden cramps can sink the most accomplished swimmer. • Allow swimming only during daylight hours and in good weather. • Remind non-swimmers and swimming supervisors of the dangers of relying on inflatable toys (e.g., inner tubes). Inflatable toys can leak and no longer provide support, and they can also create barriers to effective supervision. • Ensure children stay within specified boundaries. • When distance swimming at the beach, make sure that children swim parallel to the shore. • Always know the depth of the water and ensure it is clear of all obstacles before diving. • Post “No Diving” signs around above-ground pools. • Allow only one person at a time on diving boards and waterslides. • Ensure that swimmers stay away from the area underneath diving boards. 199199 Caring for Children199.",

Contact Transport Canada for more information on where to obtain your certification. Teaching Children Safety Awareness Teach children how to get help in an emergency: • Teach them to go to a trusted neighbour if they need help. • Teach them about the Block Parent Program of Canada in your area, if applicable.• Make a list of emergency phone numbers and teach children what to say when they call EMS/9-1-1: ¶Their name ¶The address they are calling from ¶What the problem is ¶The telephone number they are calling from • Teach children to “hang up last” when they call EMS/9-1-1. This way the dispatcher will have all the necessary information. • Teach children about traffic safety. Child and Youth Protection There are different types of abuse. It is important to be able to understand the different situations in which abuse toward children and youth may occur. Many of these situations are preventable, and if you are able to recognize the signs, you may be able to intervene on a child or youth’s behalf. Vulnerable Children and Youth All children and youth live with some risk of experiencing abuse, violence, neglect, and bullying or harassment. Abuse and Violence Abuse and violence may take different forms: emotional, physical, and Emotional abuse is defined as chronic attacks on a child or youth’s self- Physical abuse occurs when a person in a position of power or trust purposefully injures or threatens to injure a child or youth. Sexual abuse occurs when a younger or less powerful child is used by an older or more powerful child, adolescent, or adult for sexual gratification. Caring for Children200.",

    "content": "Violence is the intentional threat or use of physical force or power. It can be directed against oneself, another person, a group, or a community. It usually results in injury, death, psychological harm, abnormal development, or deprivation. Neglect is the chronic inattention to the basic necessities of life, such as clothing, shelter, nutritious diet, education, good hygiene, supervision, medical and dental care, adequate rest, a safe environment, moral guidance and discipline, exercise, and fresh air. Understanding Bullying and Harassment Bullying involves a person expressing his or her power through the humiliation of another person. Types of Bullying • Physical: Hitting or kicking people, or taking or damaging their property or possessions. • Verbal: Name-calling, insults, negative comments, and constant • Relational: Trying to cut targets off from social connection by convincing peers to exclude or reject them. • Reactive: Engaging in bullying, as well as provoking bullies into attacking, by taunting. • Cyberbullying: Sending mean, cruel, and/or defamatory messages or images by electronic means (e.g., email, text messaging, instant messaging (IM), or personal and social websites). Harassment According to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, discrimination is treating people \"differently, negatively or adversely\" on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination under federal, provincial, or territorial human rights legislation.Types of Harassment • Personal harassment: Based on an individual’s personal characteristics that are prohibited grounds for discrimination (e.g., • Sexual harassment: Unwelcome behaviour of a sexual or gender- based nature that negatively affects the person or the environment. • Criminal harassment: When the harassing behaviour contravenes Canada’s Criminal Code; also referred to as stalking. Responding to Disclosures A disclosure occurs when someone shares something with you in confidence. If someone discloses that they have experienced abuse, violence, neglect, or bullying, you must always act. How to Respond to Disclosures If you are responding to a disclosure, you need to ask yourself three basic questions: 1. What do I need to know? 2. What do I need to do? 3. When do I need to do it? Your jurisdiction’s Child Protection Act may govern how you must respond to a disclosure.Abuse is a protection issue. Bullying is a relationship issue. Harassment is a human rights issue.

    "content": "Generally speaking, you should avoid moving an injured or ill person to give care. Unnecessary movement can cause additional injury and pain and may complicate the person’s recovery. Three general situations require you to move a person: 1. There is an immediate danger (either a danger to you or to the person being rescued) e.g., from fire, a lack of oxygen, risk of drowning, a possible explosion, a collapsing structure, or uncontrolled traffic hazards. 2. You have difficulty accessing ill or injured people. For example, a person with minor injuries may need to be moved quickly to allow access to other people who may have life-threatening conditions. 3. There is a barrier that makes it difficult to provide proper care. For example, a person with a medical emergency, such as a cardiac arrest or heat stroke, may need to be moved to provide proper care. For example, a person in cardiac arrest requires CPR, which should be performed on a firm, flat surface. If the person collapses on a bed or in a small bathroom, the surface or space may not be adequate to provide appropriate care, and the person will need to be moved. Usually, you will not face hazards that require you to move the person immediately. In most cases, you can give the necessary care wherever you find the person. Needless movement of a person can lead to further injury, and therefore should be avoided. For example, moving someone with a closed fracture of the leg, without taking the time to splint it, could result in an open fracture if the end of the bone tears the skin. This may result in soft-tissue damage, damage to nerves, blood loss, and infection.Some rescue situations make gaining access to people especially challenging, and as such require first responders who have specialized training and equipment. One such situation is when the ill or injured person is in a confined space. Confined spaces are particularly challenging because they: • Are not designed or intended to have people in them • Have restricted entrances or exits due to their location, size, or • Can present a risk to the health and safety of anyone who enters (including first responders), due to one or more of the following ¶Their design, construction, location, or atmosphere ¶The materials or substances inside ¶Work activities being carried out inside Before you act, you must consider the limitations of the situation. Considering the following factors will help you ensure that you move a person quickly and safely: • Dangerous conditions at the scene • The size of the person • Your own physical ability • Whether others can assist you • The person’s condition Failing to consider these factors could result in an injury to the First Aider—you. If you become injured, you may be unable to move the person and may risk making the situation worse. Back injuries (and other musculoskeletal injuries) can occur as a result of lifting and carrying a great deal of equipment during an emergency. If this happens at a scene, you will not be able to help and another First Aider will have to provide care for you, in addition to the other ill or injured person/people.

    "content": "To protect yourself and the ill or injured person, follow these guidelines when moving someone: • Attempt to move a person only when you are sure you can comfortably handle the rescue. • Walk carefully, using short steps. • Walk forward with the person, instead of backward, wherever • Always take the shortest, most direct route to your destination, as long as it is safe. • Scan the pathway you want to use before moving so that you can identify potential hazards (such as slip hazards or poor lighting). them as a unit. This will reduce twisting forces. • Reduce the height or distance you need to move a weight and lift in stages, if necessary. • Keep your wrists and knees in normal alignment. If performed incorrectly, reaching for a person or object can also injure the ligaments of your back. When reaching, keep your back locked (avoid hyperextending it) and never twist your back. You should avoid reaching more than 15 to 20 centimetres (6 to 8 in.) in front of the body as the muscles in your upper back and shoulders can only stay stretched in that position for a matter of seconds before they become fatigued and the risk of injury increases. How to Move an Ill or Injured Person There are many different ways to move someone to safety. The move is successful as long as you can move the person without injuring yourself, causing further injury to the person, or taking unnecessary risks. Assists, carries, and drags are the different ways you can safely move an injured person. The most common of these moves include the following: • Walking assist • Two-person seat carry • Clothes drag • Blanket drag • Extremity lift These moves can be performed by one or two people without specialized equipment. This is important because equipment is often not immediately available and time is usually critical when a person must be moved. There are specific ways to deal with confined spaces (e.g., a grain silo, vat, or pipe). Without appropriate training, you are putting yourself at risk if you enter them. Ensure that the appropriate responders are on the way and manage the scene until they arrive. Only people with specialized training and equipment should enter confined spaces. Body Mechanics To reduce the risk of personal injury, everyone involved in a lift or carry should use proper body mechanics (also called “biomechanics”). The basic principles of body mechanics that can be used for all lifts and moves include the following: • Use your legs, not your back, to lift. When lifting, use the muscles of your legs, hips, buttocks, and abdomen. Never use the muscles of your back to move or lift a heavy load. • Keep the weight as close to you as possible. Reduce the distance you have to reach. • Keep your body aligned. Imagine a straight line running from your shoulders through your hips and down to your feet, and then move 205205 Appendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person205.",

Traditional basket stretchers are constructed of metal support frames, usually combined with a wire mesh lining. Other basket stretchers have metal frames and high-impact plastic liners. Basket stretchers are commonly used for rescues and also as lifting devices. Follow these guidelines when using a basket stretcher: • Place blankets under the person for comfort. • Place a backboard or litter board on the bottom to make loading and unloading easier. • If used in combination with a scoop stretcher, the basket stretcher must be able to accommodate the scoop stretcher. • Secure the person if the stretcher is to be carried over a long distance or the person is to be lowered or raised off the ground as in a low- or high-angle rescue.

It has an adjustable head section and leg section. Each side of the stretcher has a safety rail. The stretcher should not be lifted using these rails. This stretcher is commonly used in transportation vehicles, such as ambulances. Flexible Litter A flexible litter has no rigid structure of its own. These devices are made of synthetic materials that require some type of spinal immobilization device to provide rigidity. Because they are flexible, they work well when moving peoples through narrow passageways. They wrap around the person, so the litter is little more than the circumference of the person’s body. Flexible litters also have the distinct advantage of being usable with people of a variety of sizes, including those for whom a basket stretcher may be restrictive. Stair Chair A stair chair is used for transporting a person in a sitting position. It is used when a wheeled stretcher is deemed to be too long for the rescue or extrication. It is especially useful when there is a small elevator or staircase in which a long stretcher will not fit. The front wheels swivel to manoeuvre around tight corners and landings. Some stair chairs have a track that make navigating stairs or steep terrains easier for the First Aiders. When using the stair chair, it is recommended that three First Aiders be present to ensure a person’s safety: two First Aiders to act as carriers and one to serve as a spotter for potential difficulties.

    "content": "As a First Aider, you need a basic understanding of normal human structure and function. Knowing the body’s structures and how they work will help you more easily recognize and understand illnesses and injuries. Body systems do not function independently. Each system depends on other systems to function properly. When your body is healthy, your body systems are working well together. But an injury or illness in one body part or system will often cause problems in others. Knowing the location and function of the major organs and structures within each body system will help you to more accurately assess a patient’s condition and provide the best care. Body Systems The human body performs many complex functions. Vital organs are organs whose functions are essential for life, such as the brain, heart, and A body system is a group of organs and other structures that are especially adapted to perform specific body functions. They work together to carry out a function needed for life. For example, the heart, blood, and blood vessels make up the circulatory system, which keeps all parts of the body supplied with oxygen-rich blood. For the body to work properly, all of the body’s systems must work well together. When one or more of the body systems does not perform its function properly, illness can occur.Interrelationships of Body Systems Each body system plays a vital role in survival. Body systems work together to help the body maintain a constant healthy state. When the environment changes, the body’s systems adapt to the new conditions. For example, because the musculoskeletal system works harder during exercise, the respiratory and circulatory systems must also work harder to meet the body’s increased oxygen demands. Your body systems also react to the stresses caused by illness or injury. The impact of an injury or a disease is rarely restricted to one body system. For example, a broken bone may result in nerve damage that may impair movement and feeling. Injuries to the ribs can make breathing difficult. If the heart stops beating for any reason, breathing will also stop. In any significant illness or injury, body systems may be seriously affected. This may result in a progressive failure of multiple body systems. Generally, the more body systems that are involved in an emergency, the more serious the emergency.

To maintain a clean, hazard-free workplace, all groups – management, supervision, and workers – must cooperate. Regulations for safehousekeeping require – daily jobsite cleanup – disposal of rubbish – individual cleanup duties for all workers – materials piled, stacked, orotherwise stored toprevent tipping andcollapsing – materials stored away from overhead powerlines– work and travel areas kept tidy, well-lit, and ventilated (Figure 8) – signs posted to warn workers of hazardous areas. The basics of good housekeeping are shown in Figure 9. • Gather up and remove debris as often as required to keep work and travel areas orderly. • Keep equipment and the areas around equipment clear of scrap and waste. • Keep stairways, passageways, and gangways free of material, supplies, and obstructions at all times. • Secure loose or light materials stored on roof or on open floors to prevent them being blown by the wind. • Pick up, store, or dispose of tools, material, or debris which may cause tripping or other hazards. • Before handling used lumber, remove or bend over protruding nails and chip away hardened concrete. • Wear eye protection when there is any risk of eye injury. • Do not permit rubbish to fall freely from any level of the project. Lower it by means of a chute or other approved devices (Figure 10). • Do not throw materials or tools from one level to • Do not lower or raise any tool or equipment by its own cord or supply hose.• When guardrails must be removed to land, unload, or handle material, wear fall-arrest equipment (Figure11). The area must also beroped off with warning signsposted. In shops it is relatively easy tomaintain a clean work area. Barriers and warning lines can also be set up toisolate table saws and other equipment. On construction sites, arrangements aremore difficult. Equipment often sits inbasements, on decks, or in cornerswith insufficient working space andsometimes it’s open to the weather.The footing may simply consist ofa piece of plywood. Around table saws and similar equipment, keep theimmediate area clear ofscrap to avoid tripping hazards and providesound footing. Airborne wood dust can be a respiratory hazard, causing problems ranging from simple irritation of the eyes, nose,and throat to more serious health effects. Dust collectorsshould be installed in shops to remove sawdust from air and equipment. Wood dust is also very flammable. In construction, saws and other tools are often operated in the open air where dust presents no hazard. However,dust masks or respirators should be worn wheneverventilation is inadequate. Keep stairs and landings cl ear and well-lit. Good housekeeping means cl ear t raffic and work areas, ou t-of-the-way storage, ade quate illuminat ion, and c leanup o f debris.

    "content": "31 – 2TRENCHING Soil types The type of soil determines the strength and stability of trench walls. Identifying soil types requires knowledge, skill, and experience. Even hard soil may containfaults in seams or layers that make it unstablewhen excavated. The foreman or supervisor must be knowledgeable about soil types found on aproject and plan protection accordingly. Thisknowledge must include an awareness that soiltypes and conditions can change over very shortdistances. It is not unusual for soil to changecompletely within 50 metres or for soil tobecome saturated with moisture over evensmaller distances. The Construction Regulation sets out four soil types. If you are unsure about the soil type,have the soil tested to confirm the type. Type 1 — It is hard to drive a pick into Type 1 soil. Hence, it is often described as “hardground to dig”. In fact, the material is so hard, itis close to rock. When excavated, the sides of the excavation appear smooth and shiny. The sides will remainvertical with no water released from the trenchwall. If exposed to sunlight for several days, the walls of Type 1 soil will lose their shiny appearancebut remain intact without cracking andcrumbling. If exposed to rain or wet weather, Type 1 soil may break down along the edges of theexcavation. Typical Type 1 soils include “hardpan,” consolidated clay, and some glacial tills. Type 2 — A pick can be driven into Type 2 soil relatively easily. It can easily be excavatedby a backhoe or hand-excavated with somedifficulty.In Type 2 soil, the sides of a trench will remainvertical for a short period of time (perhapsseveral hours) with no apparent tension cracks.However, if the walls are left exposed to air andsunlight, tension cracks will appear as the soilstarts to dry. The soil will begin cracking andsplaying into the trench. Typical Type 2 soils are silty clay and less dense Type 3 — Much of the Type 3 soil encountered in construction is previously excavated material. Type 3 soil can be excavated without difficultyusing a hydraulic backhoe. When dry, Type 3 soil will flow through fingers and form a conical pile on the ground. DryType 3 soil will not stand vertically and thesides of the excavation will cave in to a naturalslope of about 1 to 1 depending on moisture. Wet Type 3 soil will yield water when vibrated by hand. When wet, this soil will stand verticallyfor a short period. It dries quickly, however,with the vibration during excavation causingchunks or solid slabs to slide into the trench. All backfilled or previously disturbed material should be treated as Type 3. Other typical Type3 soil includes sand, granular materials, and siltyor wet clays. Type 4 — Type 4 soil can be excavated with no difficulty using a hydraulic backhoe. Thematerial will flow very easily and must besupported and contained to be excavated to anysignificant depth. With its high moisture content, Type 4 soil is very sensitive to vibration and otherdisturbances which cause the material to flow. Typical Type 4 material includes muskeg or other organic deposits with high moisturecontent, quicksand, silty clays with highmoisture content, and leta clays. Leta clays arevery sensitive to disturbance of any kind.",

Time is also a criticalfactor. Some trenches will remain open for along period, then suddenly collapse for noapparent reason. Figure 3 shows the typical causes of cave-ins. The main factors affecting trench stability are soil type, moisture, vibration, surcharge,previous excavation, existing foundations, andweather. Moisture content The amount of moisture in the soil has a great effect on soil strength. Once a trench is dug, the sides of the open excavation are exposed to the air. Moisturecontent of the soil begins to change almostimmediately and the strength of the walls maybe affected. The longer an excavation is open to the air, the greater the risk of a cave-in. Trench open for extended duration may collapse without apparent reason. Equipment vibration affects stability.Backfill is less stable thanundisturbed soil.

    "content": "31 – 4TRENCHING Vibration from various sources can affect trench stability. Often trench walls are subject to vibration from vehicular traffic or from construction operationssuch as earth moving, compaction, pile driving,and blasting. These can all contribute to thecollapse of trench walls. A surcharge is an excessive load or weight thatcan affect trench stability. For instance, excavated soil piled next to the trench can exert pressure on the walls.Placement of spoil piles is therefore important.Spoil should be kept as far as is practical fromthe edge of the trench. Mobile equipment andother material stored close to the trench alsoadd a surcharge that will affect trench stability. One metre from the edge to the toe of the spoil pile is the minimum distance requirement(Figure 4). The distance should be greater fordeeper trenches. Previous excavation Old utility trenches either crossing or runningparallel to the new trench can affect the strengthand stability (Figure 5). Soil around and between these old excavations can be very unstable. At best it is consideredType 3 soil — loose, soft, and low in internalstrength. In some unusual circumstances it maybe Type 4 — wet, muddy, and unable tosupport itself. This kind of soil will not stand up unless it is sloped or shored. Existing foundations Around most trenches and excavations there is afailure zone where surcharges, changes in soilcondition, or other disruptions can causecollapse. When the foundation of a building adjacent to the trench or excavation extends into this failurezone, the result can be a cave-in (Figure 6). Soilin this situation is usually considered Type 3. Rain, melting snow, thawing earth, and overflowfrom adjacent streams, storm drains, and sewersall produce changes in soil conditions. In fact,water from any source can reduce soil cohesion(Figure 7). Existing foundations are surrounded by backfill and may add a surcharge load to the pressure on the trench wall. Move spoil pile farther back for deep trenches Old utilities are surrounded by backfilled soil which is usually less stable than undisturbed soil.",

For more information on confined spaces andcontrols, see the chapter on Confined Spaces inthis manual. Hydrostatic testing Hydrostatic testing involves entry into a confinedspace such as a manhole or valve chamber. Theprocedures listed above should be followed. Testing new lines can be very hazardous if components break or plugs let go. For thatreason, additional precautions are required. When testing watermains, ensure that all lines, elbows, and valves are supported and equippedwith thrust blocks. Otherwise the line couldcome apart under test pressure. Arrange watermain testing so that lines are pressurized when no one is in the manhole orvalve chamber. For sewer line testing, all requirements for entering confined spaces apply. Ensure that plugs are secure. No one should be in a manhole when the upstream line is beingfilled. Plugs that are not properly installed canlet go, causing injury and letting a manhole fillquickly, depending on the size of the line. Flooding is another reason why no one should be in a manhole without a rescue harness and aworker outside ready and prepared for anemergency.

    "content": "32 – 132 PROPANE INTRODUCTION Packaged under pressure, propane gas presents three hazards if misused: 1. high flammability and explosive potential 2. displacement of breathable air in confined spaces (also, being heavier than air, propane will collect inlow areas) 3. contact injury from accidental exposure to a substance under high pressure. We will not cover the use of propane in the roofingindustry. Propane: Physical Characteristics Propane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a by-productof petroleum or natural gas refiningwhich is packaged under pressure incylinders. In its stored state it is aliquid but is released from thecylinder or tank in a gaseous form.The boiling point of propane, thepoint at which the liquid converts toa gas, is -42.2°C (-44°F). If thesurrounding air temperature is abovethis, gas will form in the upper partof the cylinder (Figure 1). The pressure within the container is variable depending on the temperature to which the container isexposed (Table 1). The pressureincreases as the temperature rises,causing expansion of the liquid. For this reason containersare never fully charged with liquid, but have a vapourspace at the top of the tank to allow for normal expansion. Should the temperature rise above safe limits, a relief valve will open to allow release of the gas in a measuredamount. This release is generally over in seconds. Thevalve reseals and remains closed until the pressure buildsup again. Cylinder relief valves are set at 2585.5 kPa (375lb per square inch). Propane is packaged in a number of cylinder types and sizes to meet a variety of applications: • 100-lb cylinders for construction heaters, roofing kettles, and other appliances that consume large amounts of fuel. They are called 100 lb cylindersbecause they are charged with 100 lb of liquid at thepropane plant. • 20-lb cylinders for oxypropane welding set-ups. (This is a familiar size that will be used on such appliancesas household gas barbecues.) • 10 and 20 lb cylinders for soldering work.• 14 oz. throwaway containers for various hand-held torch applications. Propane can be easily compressed from a gaseous to aliquid state in small cylinders, making it very portable.When the liquid converts back to a gas, it expands 270times in volume. Compared to natural gas, propane has aheating value that is 2.5 times greater. One cubic foot ofpropane converts to 2500 BTUs, while one cubic foot ofnatural gas converts to only 1000 BTUs. This explains whyso much energy (BTUs) can be contained in a smallcylinder, making it a very convenient fuel for the contractor. But the high-energy value of propane also makes it very dangerous to handle. It only takes a tiny leak to form anexplosive gas/air mixture. The high flammability of propane can be seen by comparing its ignition characteristics with those of gasoline (Table 2). When you consider that the heat from a lighted cigarette ranges between 1000°F and 1600°F , and that a lightedmatch produces 2000°F , all that is necessary forcombustion is a sufficient quantity of propane gas mixedwith air. This is why safety procedures must be followed sothat a very efficient energy source does not become ahazard to workers.PROPANE Cutaway view of vapour withdrawal propane cylinder Temperature/Pressure Variables (values taken from CSA Standard B149.2-M80) Table 1*kilopascals *pounds per square inch Propane Gasoline Minimum ignition 493°. 549°C 427°. 482°C temperature range (920°. 1020°F) (800°- 900°F) Flammability limits in air 2.4. 9.5% 1.3. 7.5% Vapour density (air=1) 1.52 3.50 Minimum flash point -104°C (-156°F) -51°C (-60°F).",

The purpose of this valve is to shut off gas flowshould the regulator accidentally be broken off. • To unslug the check valve, shut off the flow at the cylinder, wait a couple of minutes for the check valve toreopen, then proceed. The cylinder valve should beopened slowly to its normal limit, approximately 1-1/2 to 2 turns. Do not force the valve beyond this limit. • Secure the cylinder by tying or wiring it to a column or other upright. Keep cylinders out of traffic areas wherethey may be knocked over. • Cylinder and heater must always be in the same room so that the cylinder valve can be shut down quickly iftrouble develops. • Keep heaters away from flammable materials. The heat from a burner is effective well past the tip. • Watch for a drop in pressure or reduced flame efficiency. Thisindicates that gas is beingwithdrawn too quickly, and mayrequire additional cylinders tobe hooked up in manifold.Never attempt to increase the amount of vapour by applyingheat to the cylinder. • Where possible, use only single cylinders for heaters. However, if cylinders must be manifolded, use no more than three 100-pound cylinders (Figure 7). Ifother heaters with manifolded cylinders are to beoperated in the same area, they must be at least fiftyfeet away or be separated by a firewall. • Remember that propane is heavier than air and will collect in low areas such as trenches, pits, andbasements where it can create a flammable orexplosive situation (Figure 8). • Never attempt to tie down, defeat, or bypass safety devices on a construction heater. If the heater isdefective, replace it. If the heater is inadequate, getextra heaters or replace it with a larger one. • If the flame goes out, act with caution. Shut off the gas supply, then determine whether escaped gas isconcentrated in the area. Because of its strong odour,you can usually smell propane. However, in a confinedspace, test with a gas detection device. If escaped gasis detected or even suspected, ventilate and purge thearea thoroughly before relighting the unit. Warning: If the heater is in a confined or low-lyingarea, escaped gas can be hazardous. Never enter thearea without help standing by. Never attempt to relightuntil the gas is completely purged from the area. • Never expose any part of your skin to liquid propane. Propane under pressure is extremely cold and cancause frostbite. Always wear gloves when handlingcylinders. • Don't allow propane gas to saturate your clothing. A highly flammable situation can remain for some timeafter the exposure. Saturated clothing should beremoved and aired outside. • Never operate heaters without adequate ventilation. Follow manufacturer's recommendations on the plate. Bulk Tanks Propane construction heaters that operate from a centralbulk storage tank are common on large constructionprojects. This type of installation takes planning and closeconsultation between contractor and gas supplier toselect a safe, convenient tank storage area that will notinterfere with on-site traffic and materials handling, norinfringe on property line clearance requirements. The bulk tank and feed lines are installed by licensed service personnel, but hooking up the heaters is generally left to workers on the site. The feed lines are usually well provided with hook-up points called station valves. They consist of a shut-off and a connection point for a flexible hose. However, the same rules for hooking up to a portable container apply here. • Check for leaks at the hook-up point after installing flexible heater line. • Make sure the shut-off valve is in the same room as the heater. • If heat is required in an area that is not serviced by a valve a qualified service person should extend the line, or take off a spur line using approved piping and install a valveat its terminus. • Flexible hose lengths should never exceed 25 feet between heater andstation valve.PROPANE Typical Manifold Set-Up Heavier than air, propane gas can collect in low areas and create the potential for asphyxiation or explosion.Figure 8.",

Before letting a worker enter a confined space, the employer must develop a written confined space programmeeting the requirements of the Construction Regulation(Part II.1, Confined Spaces, sections 221.1 to 221.19).The employer must maintain the program. CONFINED SPACE PROGRAM Among the first requirements for employers developing aconfined space program is the need to assess whichworkers will be entering the confined space and thereforewhich workers will need a copy of the confined spaceprogram. Employers must provide a copy of the program to the constructor of a project. In turn, the constructor mustprovide a copy of the program to the project's joint healthand safety committee or health and safety representative,if any. A copy must also be available to other employers towhich the program relates and every worker if there is noproject joint health and safety committee or health andsafety representative. If workers from more than one employer will be entering the confined space, the constructor must prepare aconfined space coordination program . A copy of the confined space coordination document must be providedto each employer who is performing work in the confinedspace and to the project's joint health and safetycommittee or the health and safety representative. The confined space program can apply to one or more confined spaces. Program elements must include ❑a method of recognizing each confined space ❑a method for assessing the hazards to which workers may be exposed ❑a method for developing plans for controlling thehazards ❑a method for training workers ❑an entry permit system setting out measures andprocedures to be followed when working in a confined space.RECOGNIZING A CONFINED A confined space is defined as a place a)that is partially or fully enclosed b)that is not both designed and constructed for continuous human occupancy , and c)where atmospheric hazards may occur because of its construction, location, or contents, or because of work that is done in it. All three criteria have to be met before a space is defined as a confined space. Here is more information on each ofthe criteria. Partially or fully enclosed Because air cannot move freely in and out of a partially or fully enclosed space, there is a potential for a hazardousatmosphere to be generated inside. This is especially true forspaces such as vaults, tanks, pits, trenches, or manholes. Not designed and constructed for continuous human Confined spaces are not designed or constructed for people to work in them on an ongoing basis. They areusually designed and constructed to store material,transport products, or enclose a process. But occasionally,some work must be done inside the space. Atmospheric hazards A hazardous atmosphere is one which contains any of the following: ➤an accumulation of flammable, combustible, or explosive agents ➤less than 19.5% or more than 23% oxygen, or ➤an accumulation of atmospheric contaminants thatcould result in acute (short-term) health effects which a) pose an immediate threat to life, or b) interfere with a person's ability to escape unaided from a confined space.CONFINED SPACES Coordination When workers of more than one employer perform work in the same confined space the constructormust prepare a coordination document to ensurethat the various employers perform their duties in away that protects the health and safety of allworkers. A copy of the coordination document mustbe provided to ❑each employer of workers who perform work in the same confined space ❑the project's joint health and safety committee orhealth and safety representative.",

    "content": "33 – 2HAZARD ASSESSMENT Before each time that a worker enters a confined space, a competent worker must perform a written hazard assessment. The name of the competent worker mustappear on the assessment and the employer must keep arecord of the competent worker's qualifications. The hazard assessment must take into account a)the hazards that may exist in the confined space b)the hazards that may develop while work is performed inside the confined space c)general safety hazards in the confined space. The competent worker must sign and date the assessment and give it to the employer. If requested, the employer must give copies of the assessment and competent worker's qualifications to ❑the project's joint health and safety committee, or ❑the health and safety representative, or ❑every worker involved in the confined space entry if the project has no joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative.The employer must review the assessment as often as necessary to make sure that the plans remain adequate.For example, if the potential chemical hazard changesdue to a change in process or equipment use, then theassessment must be changed. An assessment is generally required for each confined space. But if there are two or more similar confinedspaces containing the same hazards then you need onlya single assessment document. To perform a hazard assessment, you need to anticipate potential hazards. Often, the hazards of working inconfined spaces are not recognized until it's too late. For example: ➤A mixing tank was inadvertently started while a worker was inside. ➤A worker was killed by carbon monoxide gas from a gasoline-powered pump used to drain a pit. Because construction projects are not limited to new buildings, confined spaces may be encountered in a variety of places. The following table describes typicalconfined spaces and the most common hazards foundthere. Hazards in confined spaces can be divided into two distinct categories: physical hazards and atmospherichazards.CONFINED SPACES If control measures (such as continuous mechanical ventilation) are used to ensure that the concentrations of anatmospheric hazard are controlled or maintained at an appropriate level (but not eliminated) then the space would still be considered a confined space. If, however, measures are implemented to eliminate the possibility that any atmospheric hazards may occur in a space, then the confined space provisions no longer need to apply.Eliminating the possibility that an atmospheric hazard will occur is different from controlling the hazard. If workersmust enter the confined space to eliminate the hazards (by steam-cleaning or vacuuming, for example), then theconfined spaces provisions apply. EVERY CONFINED SPACE MUST BE THOROUGHLY ASSESSED AND EVALUATED BY A COMPETENT WORKER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE THE ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDCOMPLETELY. Even if a space is not defined as a confined space under the regulations, the employer must take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to protect workers entering the space. COMPETENT WORKER in relation to specific work, means a worker who a)is qualified because of knowledge, training and experience to perform the work b)is familiar with the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the provisions of the regulations that apply to the work, and c)has knowledge of all potential or actual dangerto health and safety in the work.",

Check with plant personnel on lockout and tagging procedures, and review drawings, plans, andspecifications. ➤Electrical hazards Any exposed conductors or energized equipment shouldbe identified before entry. The presence of water inconfined spaces may pose an additional electrocutionhazard where electrical circuits, equipment, and tools areused. ➤Engulfment due to uncontrolled movement of liquids and solids Liquids, sludge, fine solids, and other material may not be completely removed from confined spaces and maypresent an engulfment or drowning hazard. Useinspection ports and dipsticks, and check with plantpersonnel to evaluate such hazards. ➤Slick or wet surfaces Y ou can be severely injured from a slip or fall on icy, oily,wet, or moist surfaces. Confined spaces generally have poor lighting. Y ou oftenneed temporary lighting. In potentially explosiveatmospheres, use lighting designed for such situations. ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDS Confined spaces can present three kinds of atmospherichazards: ➤flammable, combustible, or explosive atmosphere ➤oxygen-enriched or oxygen-deficient atmosphere ➤atmospheric contaminants. The hazardous atmosphere may be due to existingconditions (e.g., residue in a tank,) or it may be created bythe work being done inside the confined space (e.g.,welding or using solvents). In some cases, removingsludge or scale can release trapped pockets of gas orvapour and create a hazardous atmosphere. Moreover,dangerous atmospheres often exist together. For instance,flammable, combustible or explosive atmospheres mayalso be toxic or cause an oxygen deficiency. FLAMMABLE, COMBUSTIBLE, OREXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERES Flammable atmospheres are generally caused by ➤evaporation of flammable liquids (e.g., gasoline) ➤by-products of chemical reactions (e.g., decomposition of organic matter to form methane). Explosive atmospheres are those in which a flammable gas or vapour is present in quantities between the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) and the Upper Explosive Limit(UEL). These limits define the “Explosive Range” whichvaries from one substance to another. Refer to the section“Fire and Explosion Hazard” of a material’s MSDS for fire-and explosion-related information. The LEL is the lowest, and the UEL the highest concentration of gas or vapour that will supportcombustion. For example, gasoline has an LEL of 1.4%and a UEL of 7.6%. Below 1.4% there is not enough fuelto burn, while above 7.6% there is too much fuel and notenough oxygen to burn. (See figure above.) The most common explosive gas likely to be encountered in sewers and other underground structures is methane-or“natural gas”-produced by decaying garbage and sewage. Other explosive gases and vapours may be present in confined spaces depending on previous contents oraccidental spills and leaks (e.g., leaking fuel-storage tanksnear service stations). Explosive ranges for common gases and vapours are listed in Table 1. These values must be considered whenselecting and operating gas-testing equipment. Combustible atmospheres can arise in grain elevators, feed mills, and some industrial settings such as bag houses, because of the large quantities of dust generated.The most common combustible dust is grain or flour dust-there have been several explosions in grain elevators.

    "content": "33 – 5OXYGEN-ENRICHED AND OXYGEN- DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES Normal outside air contains about 21% oxygen. If theconcentration of oxygen exceeds 23% it is considered“enriched”. The primary concern with oxygen-enrichedatmospheres is the increased flammability of materials.Things that would only smoulder in normal air will burnvigorously in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Oxygen-enriched atmospheres are fairly rare in construction. They are usually associated with pureoxygen escaping from leaking or ruptured oxyacetylenehoses or, on projects in industrial plants, from an oxygenline in an industrial or manufacturing process. Oxygen-deficient atmospheres, on the other hand, are fairly common. They may result from work being done(such as welding), bacterial action (which consumesoxygen), or from chemical reactions (such as rusting).Oxygen may also be displaced by another gas or vapour(e.g., carbon dioxide or nitrogen used to purge tanks,pipe, and vessels). Table 2 lists the effects of oxygendeficiency.ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINANTS Because confined spaces are poorly ventilated,atmospheric contaminants can build up to hazardouslevels very quickly. For construction in an industrial setting,the type of airborne hazard that may be encountereddepends on ❑products stored in the confined space ❑the type of work tasks performed in the confined ❑work or processes being performed near the confinedspace. The most common atmospheric contaminants in construction include hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide,sulphur dioxide, chlorine, and ammonia. Hydrogen Sulphide (H 2S) is a gas generated by the decomposition of garbage and sewage. H2S can be found in sewers, sewage treatment plants, refineries, and pulp mills. It is also found in many oil refineries since mostcrude oil in Canada has some H 2S dissolved in it. H2S is very toxic. A single breath at a concentration of about500-700 ppm (parts per million) can be instantly fatal. Atvery low concentrations, H 2S has the characteristic odour of rotten eggs. However, at about 100 ppm it can deadenyour sense of smell and create the false impression thatno hazard exists. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a very common toxic gas. It has no odour or taste and is clear and colourless. Carbon monoxide poisoning can be very subtle and may causedrowsiness and collapse followed by death. The majorsources of CO in construction include the internalcombustion engines powering saws, scissor lifts, powertrowellers, generators, and forklift trucks. Even theserelatively small engines produce high levels of CO.

    "content": "33 – 6Heating in confined areas, particularly with propane, presents special hazards and requires special safeguards.Propane is heavier than air and can collect in low-lyingareas such as trenches, basements, and shaft bottoms.Propane can also be absorbed into clothing. Workersmust therefore use extreme caution in the event ofleakage or flame-out. Direct-fired heaters release combustion emissions directly into the air where people work. Although carbon monoxide(CO) is the main concern, carbon dioxide (CO nitrogen oxides may also be a problem. Traditionally, explosive blasting has been used for demolition or breaking up rock. Blasting in a confinedspace can produce high levels of carbon monoxide. Y oumust use mechanical ventilation and perform air testsbefore workers re-enter the blast area to ensure that thecarbon monoxide levels are within acceptable levels.Sulphur Dioxide (SO 2) is a very irritating and corrosive gas with a strong sulphur-like odour which can be found in pulp-and-paper mills and oil refineries. Chlorine (Cl2) is another irritating and highly corrosive gas with a bleach-like odour used as a disinfectant in water and sewage treatment plants and a wide variety ofother industrial settings. Ammonia (NH 3) is a fairly common chemical used as a refrigerant and in making fertilizer, synthetic fibres, plastics, and dyes. Hundreds of other toxic materials may be encountered in factories, chemical plants, and similar industrial settings.The best way to obtain information regarding thepresence or absence of toxic materials is to discuss theproposed work with the client and ask for the information. FLAMMABLE PRODUCTS When using flammable materials in a confined space,take these precautions: ✓Provide adequate ventilation. ✓Control sparks (use non-sparking tools) and control other potential ignition sources ✓Extinguish all pilot lights. ✓Use specially protected lighting. ✓Have fire extinguishers handy. Contact cement is an example of a product with fire or explosion potential when used in a small area with poorventilation.

Skylights, domes, and ceilings Work is sometimes required within newly installed skylights where lighter-than-air gases and fumes mayaccumulate. Workers should be aware of this hazard. At the first signof discomfort or disorientation they should leave the areauntil it has been ventilated. Workers feeling light-headed or experiencing headaches may be inhaling these pollutants. Drowsiness ordisorientation can lead to falls. Again, leave the area untilit has been ventilated. Underground mines, tunnels, and shafts These spaces are intended for people to carry out work in them-this work is covered by specific regulation. They maypresent physical or atmospheric hazards. Many utilitiesare routed through tunnels or underground shafts wherehazardous atmospheres may collect from containers oroperations above, or be created by utility leaks (such asgas and oil). Work in shafts must be carefully planned. Because the work may be of short duration and require only atemporary platform, these jobs are often not given properattention. In addition to the areas already described, beware of apparently harmless areas such as basements, halls, andsmall rooms that can become dangerous when a lack ofventilationandhazardousmaterials oroperationscombine tocreateatmospherichazards.CONFINED SPACES Case study A construction crew finished installing a 12-foot-deep manhole without incident. After the crew left thearea, 265 pounds of nitroglycerin-based explosive in20 boreholes, each 18 feet deep, were detonated40-60 feet from the manhole. A worker who enteredthe manhole 45 minutes after the explosioncollapsed within minutes, and two coworkersdescended into the manhole to rescue him. Onerescuer retrieved the unconscious worker beforecollapsing on the surface, and the other rescuer diedin the manhole. An investigation determined that carbon monoxide released from the explosion had migrated throughthe soil into the manhole. Carbon monoxideconcentrations at the bottom of the manhole two days after the incident were 1,905 ppm (parts per million). This concentration was well above 1,200ppm, the concentration classified as ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH). Tests followingventilation of the manhole showed that high levels ofcarbon monoxide reappeared as a result of continued migration from the surrounding soil. Subsequent monitoring of the manhole showed adecline in carbon monoxide levels over the next 8days. If a worker can be injured by inhaling a hazardous gas, vapour, dust, or fume or there is an explosionhazard then you must provide adequate ventilationby natural or mechanical means. If this is notpossible then you must provide respiratoryprotection equipment suitable for the hazard.",

    "content": "33 – 8PLAN FOR CONTROLLING Once the hazards have been identified in the assessment,a competent person must develop a plan to eliminate or control the hazards. The primary objective of the plan is to eliminate the hazard before entry. If this is not possible, then controls, measures, and procedures must be put in place to ensurethat workers are not in danger. If confined spaces are of similar construction and present the same hazards, a single plan can be used. Still, theindividual confined spaces must be identified in both thehazard assessment and the plan. The Plan is the program element with the most regulatory requirements attached to it. The regulation outlines 11mandatory requirements that must be contained in theplan: 1)Duties of workers 2)Coordination document (prepared by the constructor) if workers of more than one contractor enter the same confined space 3)On-site rescue procedures 4)Rescue equipment (inspected by a competent worker) and methods of communication 5)Protective clothing and protective equipment 6)Isolation of energy and control of material movement 7)Attendants 8)Adequate means of access and egress (entry and 9)Atmospheric testing (conducted by a competent 10)Adequate procedures for working in the presence ofexplosive or flammable substances 11)Ventilation and purging.We address each of these 11 mandatory requirements 1) DUTIES OF WORKERS a)Do not enter or re-enter (if the confined space has been left unoccupied and unattended) the confined space unless testing has been performed. b)Know the hazards that may be faced upon entry. Know the route of exposure (e.g., inhalation or skinabsorption), signs and symptoms, and long-termeffects of exposure. c)Know how to use the equipment (including personalprotective equipment and tools) properly. d)Maintain communication with the attendant so that theattendant can monitor your safety and be able to alert workers to evacuate the confined space. e)Alert the attendant whenever: – you recognize any warning sign or symptom of – you see a dangerous condition – an alarm is activated. f)Get out of the permit space immediately whenever – a warning system indicating a ventilation failure is – the attendant gives an evacuation order– a worker recognizes any signs or symptoms of – a person inside detects a dangerous condition– an evacuation alarm is activated. 2) COORDINATION When workers of more than one employer perform work in the same confined space, the constructor must coordinateentry operations. The constructor must prepare acoordination document to ensure that the variousemployers perform their duties in a way that protects thehealth and safety of all workers entering the confinedspace.

    "content": "33 – 93) RESCUE PROCEDURES The confined space plan must include written procedures for safe onsite rescue that can be implementedimmediately in case of an emergency. An adequatenumber of people must be available to carry out therescue procedures immediately. They must be trained in a)the onsite rescue procedures b)first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) c)how to use the rescue equipment necessary to carry out the rescue. 4) RESCUE EQUIPMENT The rescue equipment must be readily available, appropriate for the confined space, and inspected by acompetent worker. The competent worker must keep awritten record of the inspection. Examples of rescueequipment include harnesses and lifelines, hoist/retrievalsystems, respirators, and other personal protectiveequipment. NOTE: Y ou must consider the size of the confined space's opening when choosing rescue equipment. There is nopoint planning for a rescuer to wear a SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) unit if it doesn't fit throughthe opening. All too often, inadequate or incorrect emergency rescue response results in multiple fatalities. Here are twoexamples: ➤A worker collapsed shortly after entering a degasser tank. His coworker went in after him and collapsed aswell. ➤A contractor went to test acid-tainted water and wasdiscovered by a worker floating in a well of the above-ground pump house. The worker went to his rescueafter calling 911 but was himself overcome. Two paramedics responding to the call were also struck down. All four victims died. Even with the best planned and executed entry there is a chance of a sudden change in conditions. The changecould be due to factors recognized earlier but for which no “absolute” protection exists, such as the failure of a respirator, the introduction of a new hazard, or collapsefrom heart attack or illness. In such cases you need a rescue plan that has been practiced and works. 5) PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Protective clothing and equipment suitable for one material may not be suitable for others. For example,polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic is resistant to most acids,but it can be softened or penetrated by many commonsolvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. For this reason, a knowledgeable person should assess the protective clothing and equipment needed (e.g.,gloves, boots, chemical suits, fire resistant coveralls-aswell as hearing, respiratory, eye, and face protection).Don't forget that if workers need personal protectiveequipment, they must be trained in its use. Respiratory protective equipment should be used where ventilation is impractical or inadequate. Certain basic rules apply to the equipment. First of all, you need to select the proper type of respirator. Oxygen-deficient atmospheres requiresupplied-air respirators—either airline types withemergency reserves or SCBA (self-contained breathingapparatus) as in the figures on the next page. In toxic atmospheres, you must use supplied-air respirators if the concentration of the gas or vapourexceeds the level considered to be ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH), or if the concentrationis unknown.CONFINED SPACES Dialing 911 is not a sufficient rescue response. SCBA note : Because the amount of air supply in standard SCBA cylinders is rated for a specific timeperiod, it is very important to plan your tasks,especially rescues operations, accordingly. Heavywork and stress will increase breathing rates andworkers will use up the air in less than the ratedtime. An alarm sounds when the air supply is low. Remember, rushing into a confined space to helpyour buddy who is laying on the ground will likelyresult in your own death. Rescuers are no good to thevictim if they also become victims. Many cases ofmultiple fatalities involve would-be rescuers overcomebecause of inadequate preparation.",

The attendant is not allowed to enter theconfined space, unless he or she is replaced by anotherattendant in accordance with the plan. The attendant must ✓remain alert outside and near to the entrance ✓be in constant communication (visual or speech) with all workers in the confined space ✓monitor the safety of workers inside the confinedspace ✓provide assistance as necessary ✓be provided with a device for summoning help in case of emergency, and ✓initiate an adequate rescue procedure in case of an emergency. 8) ENTRY AND EXIT (ACCESS AND The means of entry and exit can be evaluated beforeentry by checking drawings, by prior knowledge, or simplyby inspection from outside the space. Confined space openings are generally small and not well located. These small openings must be considered in therescue plan since they restrict the movement of workersand equipment in and out of confined spaces. Entry and exit for top-side openings may require ladders. Ladders must be well secured. Performing an emergencyrescue on workers trapped in such areas requires carefulplanning and practice. 9) ATMOSPHERIC TESTING If the hazard assessment determines that there is anatmospheric hazard in the confined space, you mustperform atmospheric testing. 1)The employer must appoint a competent worker to perform adequate tests safely before and during the time a worker is in a confined space to ensure that acceptable atmospheric levels are maintained. Thecompetent worker who will perform the tests mustreceive training in the operation, calibration, andmaintenance of the instruments. Most manufacturerscan provide necessary training. 2)If the confined space has been left unoccupied andunattended, you must perform the testing again. 3)The competent worker performing the tests must use properly calibrated and maintained instruments appropriate for the hazards in the confined space. 4)Results of every sample of a test must be recordedon the entry permit. If continuous monitoring is performed, test results must be recorded at adequate intervals. Gas detection instruments Gas detection instruments can take many forms- “personal” or “area,” single-gas or multiple-gas detectors,detectors with dedicated sensors or those withinterchangeable sensors.CONFINED SPACES The attendant is not allowed to enter the confinedspace to perform a rescue even after help hasarrived unless he or she is replaced by anotherattendant in accordance with the plan.

    "content": "33 – 12If a monitor is worn by the worker it isreferred to as“personalmonitoring.”Personal monitoringgives informationabout theconcentration ofhazardoussubstancessurrounding the worker. It is particularly useful when theworker is moving from place to place within the confinedspace. Area sampling is done before entry or re-entry. As much of the confined space area as possible should be tested,including the bottom, mid level, top, and corners. Single-gas detectors measure only one gas while multi- gas monitors are available with several toxic sensoroptions and have the flexibility of measuring many gasessimultaneously. Most multi-gas monitors include anoxygen sensor, aflammable/combustible gassensor, and one or two sensors for detecting specific toxic gases. Newersingle and multi-gasinstruments offer theflexibility of interchangeablesensors. Y ou can change thesensors to suit theapplication in hand. For example, a single-gas detectorused to check hydrogen sulphide levels can be used tomonitor carbon monoxide concentrations after you changethe sensor. Key steps to follow when you suspect adangerous atmosphere Select the appropriate type of calibrated instruments for the hazards identified in the assessment. Y ou must understand the characteristics of the work area in order to choose the right instruments. Different types ofconfined spaces present different kinds of toxic gashazards. There are hundreds of different toxics gases orvapours. Y ou need a familiarity with the characteristics ofthe confined space in order to narrow down thepossibilities and choose equipment. Y ou must use a calibrated monitor that is capable of measuring the hazardous atmosphere found in the confined space. For example, if a propane heater is being used inside a confined space, then you need calibratedmonitors capable of measuring oxygen levels, carbonmonoxide, and combustible gases. You must calibrate, maintain, and use the equipment in accordance with the manufacturer'srecommendations. If the meter is not properly calibrated, you cannot rely upon its results. Deaths can occur if the instrumentunderestimates the atmospheric conditions. CONFINED SPACES WARNING: Combustible gas detectors should notbe used to assess toxic atmospheres. Mostcombustible gas detectors do not respond to lowconcentrations of gases. For example, H2S isflammable from 4.3% to 44%. But it is ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) at 100 parts permillion (0.01%) and would not be detected at thisconcentration by most combustible gas detectors.Most other toxic gases that are also flammable aredangerous in concentrations well below the LEL. Most confined-spaceinstrumentmanufacturers nowoffer \"docking\"stations that canautomaticallycalibrate instrumentsand print a record ofcalibration. Thestations also rechargeand store theinstruments.",

    "content": "33 – 13Perform the tests safely. Entry into a confined space must be prohibited before the appropriate tests are performed. Atmospheres should beevaluated remotely (from outside the confined space)before each entry. If possible, an extendable probe shouldbe inserted through an inspection port or other openingbefore removing large doors or covers. Make sure that as much of the space as possible is tested, including the bottom, mid-level, top, and corners,so that you don't miss layers or pockets of bad air. (Seefigure below). There are some gases that are lighter orheavier than air. Lighter gases, such as methane, willaccumulate at the top, while gases heavier than air willsink to floor level. Gases that are the same weight as air,such as carbon monoxide, will be found throughout aconfined space. Check for oxygen content, combustible or explosive gases and vapours, and toxic gases and vapours inthat order if you use more than one meter. First, check for oxygen content. Checking oxygen first is important because you may need adequate oxygen to geta valid result from other tests. If the oxygen level is adequate, test for explosive atmospheres. Several different calibration gases areavailable. Methane is used most frequently since it is acommon gas found in many places. But you can getdevices calibrated for propane, hexane, heptane, oralmost any other combustible gas. These devices give aresult expressed as a percentage of the lower explosivelimit (LEL) for the calibration gas used. The next thing to check for is the presence of toxic gases and vapour using a calibrated instrument. If you're using a multi-gas monitor capable of measuring oxygen, combustibles, and toxic gases simultaneouslythen the order of testing is not as critical. All three types of dangerous atmospheres must be evaluated before entry. Users of gas detectors must be competent workers. They must also receive training in theoperation, calibration, and maintenance of the devices.Most manufacturers can provide necessary training. You may need to monitor the atmosphere continuously. Continuous monitoring in a confined space is required while hot work is being performed in a potentiallyflammable or explosive atmosphere or where theflammable or explosive atmosphere has been renderedinert by adding an inert gas. It should also be consideredwhen conditions in the confined space change rapidly. If continuous monitoring is performed then test results must be recorded at regular intervals. Most confined space instruments have data-logging capabilities. Data-logging is useful for compliance andrecord-keeping purposes. If an accident or unusual eventhappens, data-logging may be useful for demonstratingdue diligence. Interpret the results. There may be other gases present in the confined space that interfere with the reading for the gas you are trying tomeasure. Such gases are referred to as “interferinggases.” They can lead to misinterpretation of the monitoring results. If the atmosphere meets acceptable exposure limits (see next page) the confined space may be entered. If theatmosphere does not meet acceptable limits, you need toimplement controls before anyone can enter.CONFINED SPACES Always test for the three dangerous atmospheres: ❑too much or too little oxygen ❑combustible or explosive gases or vapours ❑toxic gases or vapours. Know the limitations of your specific equipment.Consult the manufacturer's instructions for properuse. Temperature, humidity, and interfering gases can all affect the performance of gas monitors.",

    "content": "34 – 4FRIABLE AND NON-FRIABLE Two classes of asbestos products were widely used inthe past. The first includesmaterials easily crumbled orloose in composition. Theseare referred to as “friable.” The second type includes materials much more durablebecause they are held togetherby a binder such as cement,vinyl, or asphalt. Theseproducts are termed “non-friable.” Friable material was widely used to fireproof steelstructures. It can be found onbeams, columns, trusses,hoists, and steel pan floors.Sprayed material was alsoused as a decorative finishand as acoustical insulation on ceilings. The material can be loose, fluffy, and lumpy in texture or,if more gypsum was used, itmay be quite hard and durable.CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING Certification: Type 3 operations All workers who perform Type 3 asbestos operations—and the supervisors of these workers—must be certified to dotheir work. (Type 3 operations are discussed later in thischapter.) This certification requirement is contained inOntario Regulation 278/05. There are two certificationprograms: one for workers and one for supervisors.Supervisors must complete both the worker program andthe supervisor program. The certification programs mustcomply with the Ministry of Training, Colleges, andUniversities’ training standards for the programs. ContactIHSA for details (1-800-781-2726). Training for any “Type” of asbestosoperation Whenever work is planned at a location where asbestos is present, constructors and employers must inform workers ❑the location of asbestos-containing materials or materials assumed to contain asbestos ❑whether the material is friable or non-friable, and ❑the type of asbestos (e.g., chrysotile, amosite,tremolite, etc.) if the material is sprayed. Constructors and employers must then ensure that workers are trained on asbestos hazards and controls asdetailed on the next page. Employers performing regular service or maintenance work on behalf of owners have these same training requirements. Such employers should develop safe workpractices. They should also become familiar with theowner's asbestos procedures and communicate them totheir employees.ASBESTOS Friable Materials Approved Fireproofing Acoustical Coating Sprayed Fireproofing Air-Cell Pipe Insulation Non-Friable Materials Suspended Ceiling Concealing Fireproofing Asbestos-Cement Siding Vinyl Asbestos Floor Tile.",

    "content": "Content of training All workers who perform a Type 3 asbestos operation, and the supervisors of the operation, must be certified to dotheir work. See the section on “Certification: Type 3operations” on the previous page. Workers in any “Type” of asbestos operation—as well as other workers who could be exposed to asbestos—must be trained by a competent person on the following: ❑the hazards of asbestos exposure ❑the purpose, inspection, maintenance, use, fitting, cleaning, disinfecting, and limitations of respirators ❑personal hygiene and correct procedures for workwith asbestos ❑how to use, clean, and dispose of protective clothing. Note: The above applies to facility owners and tenants whose staff undertake work involving the removal or disturbance of asbestos-containing material or who contract with other employees to do so. Training should also include ❑methods of recognizing asbestos, including identification of building materials that contain ❑the relationship between smoking, asbestos, and lung ❑the kinds of operations that could result in exposureto asbestos ❑classification of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 operations ❑required work procedures and controls to minimizeexposure, including engineering controls, work practices, respirators, housekeeping procedures, hygiene facilities, protective clothing, decontaminationprocedures, emergency procedures, and waste disposal procedures ❑the requirements of the medical-surveillance program ❑the requirements for signs and labels. The joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative must be informed about when andwhere the training will take place.ENCAPSULATION OR REMOVAL In dealing with asbestos that may be encountered inapplications such as fireproofing and cement, the decisionwhether to encapsulate the material, remove it, or leave it inplace rests with the client/owner. Many owners of asbestos-containing buildings have decided to reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos. The procedure is normally either removal or encapsulation. Encapsulationmeans spraying an approved sealant onto or into thematerial to prevent the release of fibres into the air in thebuilding. Encapsulation is permitted only if the asbestos will not be damaged further in the process. Removal of asbestos is a more permanent solution to the problem. Most removal projects employ the wet removalmethod. Water and a wetting agent are sprayed onto theasbestos. This effectively reduces the quantity of fibresreleased when the material is removed. Dry removal is normally done only when wet removal is unsafe or impractical – for instance in computer rooms or other areas where there is a chance of water damage todelicate equipment. Dry removal causes excessively highconcentrations of asbestos fibres (in excess of 100 fibresper cubic centimetre) and may contaminate other previously “clean” areas. During dry removal projects, use an extensive filtered exhaust system to create a slight negative air pressure inthe work area. This will reduce the chance of spreading asbestos fibres. The requirements for negative air pressure are specified in the asbestos regulation. Another solution is to enclose the asbestos with a physical barrier such as drywall. This is normally done where thearea is not going to be entered frequently or altered later. The asbestos regulation specifies what precautions must be taken during removal, encapsulation, or enclosure.ASBESTOS Spraying Asbestos Ceiling Material with Amended Water Before Wet Removal.",

    "content": "34 – 6TYPES Under Ontario law, asbestos operations are classified as Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3. Type 1 – generally presents little hazard to workers or bystanders (for example, hand removal of vinyl asbestos tile). Type 2 – may create exposure exceeding acceptable limits (for example, removing six square inchesof asbestos fireproofing to attach a new pipehanger). Type 3 – major exposures, exceeding acceptable limits, involving frequent or prolonged exposure, andposing serious risks to both workers and tobystanders (for example, full-scale removal ofsprayed asbestos fireproofing in an occupiedbuilding). Ontario Regulation 278/05 (Designated Substance— Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings andRepair Operations) outlines safe work procedures and respiratory protection for workers who may encounterasbestos in the course of their work. IHSA also produces amanual called Asbestos: Controls for Construction, Renovation, and Demolition (DS037). It shows how workers can protect themselves. The manual also describes correct procedures for asbestos operations, andhelps employers and constructors understand their legalresponsibilities.TYPE 1 OPERATIONS Type 1 operations include the following: 1)Installing or removing less than 7.5 square metres ofceiling tile containing asbestos (81 square feet, or ten4-foot x 2-foot ceiling tiles) without it being broken,cut, drilled, abraded, ground, sanded, or vibrated. 2)Installing or removing non-friable asbestos-containingmaterial, other than ceiling tiles, without it being broken, cut, drilled, abraded, ground, sanded, or 3)Breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding,or vibrating non-friable asbestos-containing material if a) you wet the material, and b) you use only non-powered hand-held tools. 4)Removing less than one square metre of drywall where asbestos joint-filling compound was used (see shaded box on next page). If these operations are done properly, it is unlikely that exposure will exceed acceptable limits. See the respirator selection chart at the end of the chapter to determine the respirator you require. Y ou must also follow the control procedures described in Ontario Regulation 278/05. See IHSA’s asbestos manual (DS037)for details.ASBESTOS Wetting agent Water alone is not sufficient to control dust and fibres. Y ou must add a “wetting agent” to reduce thewater’s surface tension. This increases the water’s ability to penetrate material and get into nooks and To make this “amended water,” you can use ordinary dishwashing detergent: 1 cup detergent for every 20litres of water.",

    "content": "35 – 3The biggest uncertainty about the load-bearing capacity of ice is the natural variation in thickness and quality that can occur over a given area. Currents and springs can cause variations in thickness without changing the overallsurface appearance of the ice. Considerable variation inice thickness can occur where rivers have significantcurrents or high banks. Similar situations occur in lakes at the inlet and outlet of rivers. Only the thickness of continuously frozen ice should be used to determine bearing capacity. The basis for capacityshould be the minimum thickness measured. In addition to testing for thickness, crews should check ice for cracking. Ice thickness (Figure 128) is determined by the full thickness of clear blue ice plus half the thickness of anywhite,continuouslyfrozen ice Operations Over Ice, Treasury Board of Canada). For repeated work or travel over ice, the surface mustbe tested regularly to ensure continuedsafety. Ice mustalso be tested regularly near currents or eddies and around permanent structures like abutments. Bearing Capacity of Ice Where heavy equipment such as cranes or structures suchas concrete forms are to be placed on ice for extended periods, ask an experienced consultant for advice onbearing capacity, load methods, and inspection procedures. With professional advice it is possible to increase bearing capacity considerably. But careful control is required oversurface operations, loading procedures, and ice monitoring. In other cases, refer to Graph 1 for allowable moving loads on various thicknesses of clear blue ice. Remember: the graph is not to be used for loads parked, stored, or otherwise left stationary for long periods of time. Certain types of cracking can affect the bearing capacity of ice. For a single dry crack wider than 2.5 centimetres (1inch), reduce loads by one third; for intersecting cracks of this size, reduce loads by two thirds. Dry cracks can be repaired by filling in with water or slush. A wet crack indicates penetration through the ice to waterbelow. Bearing capacity can be dangerously lowered. Fora single wet crack, reduce loads by three quarters. Mostwet cracks refreeze as strong as the original ice. A coresample should be taken to determine the depth of healing. Other Considerations • Ice roads must be at least 40 centimetres (16 inches) thick along their entire length and should be clearly marked. • Ice roads should not be built up more than 10 centimetres (4 inches) in one day and must not be used or refloodeduntil the top layer has completely frozen. • While an ice road is in use it must be checked daily for thickness, cracks, thawing, and other conditions. • All rescue equipment listed earlier in this chapter must be readily available. • A life ring attached to 20 metres (65 feet) of polypropylene rescue rope 9.5 millimetres (3/8 inch) thick must be keptwithin 35 metres (115 feet) of the work area. • A warm place such as a truck cab or hut must be provided and made known to personnel near the worksite. For more information on the bearing capacity of ice, see Safety Guide for Operations Over Ice , by the Treasury Board of Canada.

Around table saws and similar equipment, keep the immediate area clear of scrap to avoid tripping hazards and provide sound footing. Airborne wood dust can be a respiratory hazard, causing problems ranging from simple irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat to more serious health effects. Dust collectors should be installed in shops to remove sawdust from air and equipment. Wood dust is also very flammable. In construction, saws and other tools are often operated in the open air where dust presents no hazard. However, dust masks or respirators should be worn whenever ventilation is inadequate. Storage areas should be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) away from roof or floor openings, excavations, or any open edges where material may fall off. Near openings, arrange material so that it cannot roll or slide in the direction of the opening. Secure loose material such as insulation and sheets of plywood to prevent them from blowing away in the strong wind (Figure 25-5). After removing material, resecure pile. Figure 25-5: Secure Loose Material Against the Wind Flammable Materials • Use copper grounding straps to keep static electricity from building up in containers, racks, flooring, and other surfaces (Figure 25-6). • Store fuel only in containers approved by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) or Underwriters’ Laboratories of Canada (ULC). • Ensure that electric fixtures and switches are explosion-proof where flammable materials are • See Figure 25-7 for pointers on safe storage of flammable liquids.",

This will keep them separate for special handling and disposal later. Bags and Sacks • Do not pile bagged material more than 10 bags high unless the face of the pile is supported by the walls of a storage bin or enclosure. • Do not move piles more than 10 bags high unless fully banded or wrapped. • Cross-pile bags and sacks for added stability. Pile only to a safe and convenient height for loading and unloading.Compressed Gas Cylinders • When storing and moving cylinders, keep them in the upright position. Secure cylinders upright with chains or rope. • Lock up cylinders to prevent vandalism and theft. • Wherever possible, store cylinders in a secure area • Keep full cylinders apart from empty cylinders. • Store cylinders of different gases separately. • Keep cylinders away from heat sources. • When heating with propane, keep 45-kg (100-lb) cylinders at least 3 m (10 ft) away from heaters; keep larger tanks at least 7.6 m (25 ft) away. • Stack on level sills. • Stack reusable lumber according to size and length. Remove nails during stacking. • Support lumber at every 1.2-m (4-ft) span. • Cross-pile or cross-strip when the pile will be more than 1.2 m (4 ft) high. Fire Protection Good housekeeping is essential for the prevention of fires. However, if a fire does break out in the workplace, it is important to know what kind of fire extinguisher to use and how to use it. Section 52 of the Regulation for Construction Projects (213/91) outlines specific locations and circumstances where fire extinguishers must be • Where flammable materials are stored, handled, • Where temporary oil- or gas-fired equipment is being used • Where welding or open-flame cutting is being • On each storey of an enclosed building being constructed or renovated • In workshops, for at least every 300 square metres (3,230 square feet) of floor area. Fire extinguishers must always be • Easily accessible • Well-maintained • Refilled or replaced immediately after use. They must be inspected for defects or deterioration once a month by a competent worker who records the date on the tag.",

    "content": "Construction Health and Safety ManualFire extinguishers are classified according to their capacity to fight specific types of fires. Every fire extinguisher on a construction project must have an Underwriters’ Laboratories of Canada 4A40BC rating. This type of extinguisher can be used on Class A, B, and C fires, which are the types of fires commonly encountered in construction. Class A —For fires involving ordinary combustible materials (e.g., wood, paper, plastics, textiles) and where a quenching, cooling effect is required. Class B —For fires involving flammable liquid or gas (e.g., oil, gasoline, propane, solvents) and where flame interruption by oxygen depletion is Class C —For fires involving energized electrical sources (e.g., wires, electrical panels) and where the extinguishing agent cannot be a conductor of electricity. Class D —For fires involving combustible metals (e.g., magnesium, titanium, sodium, potassium) that can react violently with water, air, or other chemicals. Extinguishers have a very short duration of discharge—usually less than 60 seconds. Be sure to aim at the base of the fire.HOUSEKEEPING AND FIRE SAFETY Know the law Every worker who may need to use a fire extinguisher must be trained in its use. (O. Reg. 213/91, s. 52).",
