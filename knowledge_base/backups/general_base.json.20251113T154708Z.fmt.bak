Section 17 of\nthe Construction Projects regulation (213/91) states:\n17. (1) A constructor shall establish for a project\nwritten procedures to be followed in the\nevent of an emergency and shall ensure that\nthe procedures are followed at the project.\n(2) The constructor shall review the\nemergency procedures with the joint health\nand safety committee or the health and\nsafety representative for the project, if any.\n(3) The constructor shall ensure that the\nemergency procedures are posted in a\nconspicuous place at the project.\nBecause the size and complexity of a project\ndiffers from site to site, the planning necessary for\nemergencies will also differ. An effective plan must\ntake into consideration the items listed below.\n1. Assessment/Hazard Identification\nIdentify hazards and assess potential risk by\nanswering these questions:\n• What can go wrong?\n• What are the consequences?\n2. Emergency Resources\nDetermine what resources are available\nfor the hazards identified and assessed.\nVerify that 911 operates in area. If not, make\nalternate arrangements.\nMaintain on-site resources such as fire\nextinguishers, spills containment equipment,\nand first aid kits. Outside help may be so far\naway that on-site resources are necessary,\nsuch as fire protection or ambulance and\nmedical resources in remote areas.3. Communication Systems\nTo relay accurate information quickly, use reliable\ncommunications equipment, develop procedures,\nand train personnel. A backup system is a good\nidea in case the emergency destroys phone lines,\nfor example.\nThe type and location of emergency\ncommunication systems must be posted on the\nproject. Emergency phone numbers and the site\naddress/location should be posted beside all site\nphones. IHSA’s Emergency Response Poster\n(P103) can be used to record this and other\ninformation (Figure 2-1).\n4. Administration of the Plan\nThe person in charge of administering and\norganizing the plan must ensure the following:\n• Everyone clearly understands their roles and\nresponsibilities within the plan.\n• Adequate emergency resources are available\nfor each stage of the project.\n• The plan is reviewed regularly and always\nafter an emergency to correct any\nshortcomings.\n5. Emergency Response Procedures\nBefore you begin work on a jobsite, make sure\nyou are familiar with the emergency response\nprocedures for that site. The Emergency\nProcedures chart (Figure 2-2) outlines standard\nemergency response procedures.\nSTOP and ASSESS the situation before\nperforming any of the tasks. Stay calm to provide\nan example to others.\nThe site supervisor should be able to provide\ninformation about:\n• Emergency warning alarms and codes\n• Emergency telephone numbers\n• Nearest hospital\n• Rescue procedures\n• Meeting or muster points\n• Names of persons capable of administering\n• Location of emergency equipment such as\nfire extinguishers.\nFigure 2-1: Emergency Response Poster EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CHAPTER 2",

Its\npurpose is to protect life and health and ensure respect for the human\nbeing. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, co-operation, and\nlasting peace amongst all peoples.\nImpartiality\nIt makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class,\nor political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals,\nbeing guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most\nurgent cases of distress.\nNeutrality\nIn order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may\nnot take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a\npolitical, racial, religious, or ideological nature.\nIndependence\nThe Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in\nthe humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of\ntheir respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that\nthey may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of\nthe Movement.Voluntary Service\nIt is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by\ndesire for gain.\nThere can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society\nin any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its\nhumanitarian work throughout its territory.\nUniversality\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement,\nin which all Societies have equal status and share equal\nresponsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.\nThe Fundamental Principles were proclaimed by the XXth\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross, Vienna, 1965. This is\nthe revised text contained in the Statutes of the International Red\nCross and the Red Crescent Movement, adopted by the XXVth\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross, Geneva, 1986.\nIn keeping with the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, the\nSociety is committed to Social Justice in the elimination of Society\nstructures and actions that oppress, exclude, limit, or discriminate\non the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, financial ability, sexual\norientation, religion, disability, or age.",

    "content": "Our History\nIn June of 1859, Henry Dunant saw an\nunforgettable scene: 40,000 dead and\nwounded soldiers left on the field after the\nBattle of Solferino in Italy. Dunant organized\nlocal villagers into first aid teams to help as\nmany of the wounded as possible, saving\nthousands of lives.\nTo prevent this horror from happening\nagain, Dunant decided to create a neutral\norganization to care for wounded soldiers\nand prisoners—an organization that would\nbe respected and protected by both sides\nin any conflict. The result was the Red Cross.\nDunant spent the rest of his life trying to\nreduce the suffering caused by war. He lobbied\ngovernments, organized Red Cross Societies in\ndifferent countries, and spoke to the public.\nIn the spring of 1885, during Louis Riel’s\nNorthwest Rebellion, Dr. George Sterling\nRyerson stitched a Red Cross made of cotton\nonto white material and used this as a flag to\ndistinguish the horse drawn wagon being used\nto transport the wounded. This was one of the\nfirst Red Cross flags ever flown in Canada.\nIn 1896, Dr. Ryerson founded the first overseas\nbranch of the British Red Cross, which later\nbecame the Canadian Red Cross.\nIn 1901, Dunant won the first Nobel Peace Prize.\nBy founding what is now the International\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement, he has\nsaved the lives of millions of people.On May 19, 1909,  The Canadian Red Cross Society Act  was approved by\nParliament, and decreed that the Canadian Red Cross would serve as\nan auxiliary to the Government of Canada for Canadians, which was a\nmeasure that was in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. (Prior to\n1909, the Canadian Red Cross operated as a branch of the British Red\nCross.) As a result, for more than a century, Canadians have had their\nown national Red Cross Society dedicated to improving the situations of\nthe most vulnerable people in Canada and around the world.\nToday, there are Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies in more than 190\ncountries, all dedicated to the same ideals and fundamental principles.\nThe Fundamental Principles\nIn every country, our programs and activities are guided by seven\nFundamental Principles. The Tanzanian Red Cross has created a short,\nsimple version of these principles:\nHumanity: We serve people, but not systems.\nImpartiality: We care for the victims and the aggressors alike.\nNeutrality: We take initiatives, but never take sides.\nIndependence: We bow to needs, but not rulers.\nVoluntary Service: We work around the clock, but never for personal gain.\nUnity: We have many talents, but a single idea.\nUniversality: We respect nations, but our work knows no bounds.\nEssentially, we provide help to people in need, whatever their race,\ngender, culture, ethnicity, financial ability, sexual orientation, religion,\ndisability, or age.\nThe Red Cross",

    "content": "Red Cross Symbols\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has three\nofficial symbols: the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal.\nAll three symbols are equivalent and share the same status under\ninternational law. Each national society of the International Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Movement chooses one of these three symbols to use\nin their country.\nThe three emblems are used to identify military medical services as well\nas the people, programs, and objects connected with the activities of the\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\nRecognized as a symbol of humanity and neutrality, the emblem is the\nonly protection Red Cross workers have when they bring relief and\nprotection to victims of armed conflicts. The emblem identifies and\nprotects the sick, the wounded and those who come to their aid, and\nmedical equipment, buildings, and vehicles.The Red Crescent\nAlthough the Red Cross emblem has no religious,\npolitical, or cultural associations, it was sometimes\nbelieved to be related to the Christian cross, and this\nassociation was problematic in certain regions and\nconflicts. In 1929, the International Federation of the\nRed Cross agreed to the adoption of an additional,\nequivalent emblem: The Red Crescent. This emblem\ncould be used by any national society in place of the\nRed Cross.\nThe Red Crystal\nIn December of 2005, the International Red Cross and\nRed Crescent Movement welcomed the decision to\ncreate an additional emblem alongside the Red Cross\nand Red Crescent: the Red Crystal.\nThe Red Cross\nThe Red Cross symbol—five red, equal-sized squares\nforming a cross resting on a white background—\nwas adopted in 1863 at the first International\nConference of what would one day be the Red Cross\nand Red Crescent Society. Today it is one of the most\nrecognized emblems in the world, and continues to be an internationally\nrespected symbol of protection and neutrality.\nThe Red Cross is the emblem that is used by the Canadian National\nSociety. No organization—except the Canadian Red Cross and the\nmedical services of the armed forces—has the right to use the Red Cross\nemblem in Canada. The Red Cross emblem must be readily recognized\nand respected around the world as a trusted symbol of protection and\nhumanitarian aid. Its use is legislated by the Geneva Conventions Act, the\nTrade Marks Act, and the Canadian Red Cross Society Act.\nThe Red Cross",

Red Cross volunteer opportunities are\ndynamic and varied, with engagement levels varying by geographic\nlocation and program. For more information on volunteering, visit\nredcross.ca or contact your local Red Cross office.How We Help\nThe Canadian Red Cross provides help in many ways:\nDisaster Management\nWhile many associate the Canadian\nRed Cross with its disaster relief efforts\naround the world, each year thousands\nof Canadians receive aid following\nemergencies such as house fires,\nflooding, ice storms, and even chemical\nspills. Following a disaster, Canadian Red Cross volunteers ensure those\naffected have access to shelter, food, clothing, hygiene items, and\nemotional support. As part of a global network of 190 national Societies,\nthe work and expertise of the Canadian Red Cross often extends beyond\nCanada’s borders. Trained Canadian personnel and resources, including\nan Emergency Response Unit specializing in health, are poised for\ndeployment within hours of a disaster.\nInternational Operations\nThe Canadian Red Cross works around\nthe world to protect and promote the\nrights of all people affected by armed\nconflict. The Geneva Conventions, laws\nthat protect the wounded, the sick,\nprisoners of war, and civilians, serve as\na mandate for the Canadian Red Cross\nin its mission to provide assistance to those in need. The Canadian Red\nCross educates Canadians on international issues including humanitarian\nlaw and development efforts. The Society recruits and trains qualified\nCanadian delegates for international field operations in countries\naffected by conflict or disaster or for long-term development missions.\nThe Red Cross",

    "content": "Preparing For Emergencies at Home\nTo be ready for an emergency at home:\n•Keep important information about yourself and your family in a\nhandy place. Include your address, everyone’s date of birth, health\ncard numbers, medical conditions, allergies, and prescriptions and\ndosages. List the names and phone numbers of your doctors.\n•Post the numbers for the police, fire department, emergency\nmedical services (EMS), and Poison Control Centre near every phone\nin your home and save these numbers in your mobile phone’s\ncontacts list.\n•Teach children how to call for help.\n•Install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Test them regularly.\n•Keep first aid kits handy in your home and car. Make sure everyone\nin the family knows where they are and what is in them.\n•Review and practice the first aid skills that you learn so that you will\nhave the confidence and knowledge to respond in an emergency.\nMost communities are served by the emergency telephone number 9-1-1.\nIf your community does not operate on a 9-1-1 system, search online or\nin your local phone directory for the numbers of the police department,\nfire department, and EMS system. Also include the number for your\nprovincial or territorial Poison Control Centre’s hotline on your list. Teach\neveryone in your home how and when to use these numbers.\nTake steps to make it easier for EMS personnel and others to help you,\nshould an emergency occur:\n•Make sure your house or apartment number is large, easy to read,\nand well-lit at all times. Numerals (e.g., “87”) are easier to see and\nread than words (e.g., “eighty-seven”).\n•Keep relevant medical information, such as a list of the medications\nthat each family member takes, in an accessible place at home and\nwhen you go out (e.g., on the refrigerator door and in your wallet or\nmobile phone).Mobile phones and other electronic devices can display emergency\ncontacts. The letters \"ICE\" (for \"In Case of Emergency\") may appear in\nthe phone’s contacts list next to the name of a doctor, spouse, or other\nimportant contact. Assigning \"ICE\" to a contact allows emergency\npersonnel to reach someone who knows important facts about the ill or\ninjured person. If the mobile phone has been programmed to include the\nICE contact with a \"0\" in front, it will appear as the first contact in the\nperson’s list\nIf you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes, epilepsy, or\nallergies, consider wearing a medical identification product to alert EMS\npersonnel of your condition in case you are unable to do so. There are\nalso applications you can use to create digital identification tags in your\nmobile phone. These tags can be viewed even\nwhen your phone is locked, and so can provide\nimportant information in an emergency (such\nas your medical conditions, blood type, and\nemergency contact details).\nIn a life-threatening emergency, every second\ncounts. By preparing for emergencies, you can\nhelp ensure that care begins as soon as possible—\nfor yourself, a family member, a co-worker, or a\nmember of your community.\nResponding to Emergencies",

    "content": "Legal Issues Around First Aid\nGood Samaritan Laws\nGood Samaritan laws, which protect First Aiders from financial liability,\nwere developed to encourage people to help others in emergency\nsituations. These laws assume a First Aider will do his or her best to save a\nlife or prevent further injury. Good Samaritan laws require the First Aider\nto use common sense and a reasonable level of skill, as well as to give\nonly the type of emergency care that is within his or her training. Good\nSamaritan laws usually protect First Aiders who act in the same manner\nas a \"reasonable and prudent person\" would in the same situation. For\nexample, a reasonable and prudent person would:\n• Move a person only if the person’s life was in danger.\n• Ask a responsive person (or the parent, guardian, or caregiver\nof a child or baby) for permission to help (consent) before\ngiving care.\n• Check a person for life-threatening conditions before\ngiving further care.\n• Call EMS/9-1-1.\n• Continue to give care until more highly trained personnel\ntake over.\nIf a First Aider’s actions are grossly negligent or reckless, or if the First\nAider abandons the person after starting care, Good Samaritan laws may\nnot protect the First Aider. Workplace First Aiders\nFirst aid in the workplace can be governed by both national and\nprovincial/territorial legislation. A workplace First Aider has additional\nresponsibilities and may be legally required to provide first aid in the\nworkplace if the need arises. He or she may also need to know other\ninformation, including:\n• Where emergency equipment is located.\n• How to properly complete documentation following a workplace\n• What the workplace-specific emergency procedures are.\n• How to call for help in an emergency.\nRefer to the legislation that governs your workplace for more\ninformation.\nGetting Permission to Help\nOnce you decide to act, you need to\nget the ill or injured person’s permission\n(also known as consent) to assist.\nTo get permission:\n1. Tell the person who you are.\n2. Tell the person that you are here\n3. Ask the person if that is okay.\nYou may be legally obligated to provide first aid as needed\nto any child or baby in your care.If a baby or a child is ill or injured:\n• Ask the parent, guardian, or caregiver for permission.\n• If the child or baby is alone, you can assume you have permission\nto give first aid.\nResponding to Emergencies",

    "content": "Special Situations\nThere are times when it is difficult\nto get permission to provide care for\nan ill or injured person or when the\nperson denies the help of First Aiders or\nbystanders:You and the Person Do Not Speak the Same Language\nIf you do not speak the same language as the injured or ill person,\nobtaining consent may be challenging. Find out if someone else at the\nscene can serve as a translator. If a translator is not available, do your best\nto communicate with the person by using gestures and facial expressions.\nWhen you call EMS/9-1-1, explain that you are having difficulty\ncommunicating with the person, and tell the dispatcher which language\nyou believe the person speaks. The dispatcher may have someone\navailable who can help with communication.\nDuty to Report Child Abuse or Neglect\nEvery adult in Canada has a legal duty to report child abuse or neglect,\neven if it is not confirmed. Information around the specific how-to-report\ndetails can be found in your jurisdiction’s Child Protection Act, but the\nduty to report is uniform in all acts. If you are responding to a first aid\nemergency and you think a child is being harmed, then there needs\nto be a report to child protection and/or police. Even if you are unsure,\nchild protection needs to be informed and needs to guide the next steps.\nAlso share your concerns with the EMS personnel who respond to the\nsituation.\nResponding to Disclosures of Violence\nA person revealing experiences of abuse—past or present—can be\nchallenging and upsetting. This is even more true if the individual\nreceiving the disclosure is close to the person and/or knows the\nperpetrator. Your response to the disclosure is critical. Studies show that\nthe manner in which a disclosure of interpersonal violence is handled is a\nsignificant factor in determining the psychological impact on the victim.\nIndifference and blame are damaging responses that can have long-\nlasting consequences.\nThe Person Is Unresponsive Or Confused, Or Has\na Mental Impairment\nSomeone who is unresponsive or confused, or who has a mental\nimpairment, may not be able to grant permission. In these cases, the law\nassumes the person would give permission if he or she were able to do\nso. This is called implied consent. Implied consent also applies when a\nchild or baby needs emergency medical assistance and his or her parent,\nguardian, or caregiver is not present.\nThe Person Refuses Care\nAn ill or injured person may refuse care, even if he or she desperately\nneeds it. A parent or guardian also may refuse care for his or her child or\nbaby. You must honour the person’s wishes. Explain to the person why\nyou believe care is necessary, but do not touch or give care to the person,\nand never attempt to give the person help by force. Remember, you\nshould never put yourself in any danger. Stay nearby, if possible, in case\nthe person later decides to accept your help or becomes unresponsive.\nIf you believe the person’s condition is life-threatening, call EMS/9-1-\n1 and communicate that a person requires medical assistance but is\nrefusing help. The EMS personnel who arrive will deal with the situation.\nIf the person gives consent initially but then withdraws it, stop giving\ncare and call EMS/9-1-1 if you have not already done so.\nResponding to Emergencies",

The complaint cannot be diminished\nor ignored. There must always be a response. Both verbal and non-\nverbal disclosures need to be handled sensitively while following specific\nprocedures. If the disclosure is from a young person, your jurisdiction’s\nChild Protection Act may govern how you respond.\nThe Emergency Medical Services System\nThe emergency medical services (EMS) system is a network of community\nresources and trained personnel, organized to give emergency care\nin cases of injury or sudden illness. The system begins when someone\nsees an emergency and decides to take action by calling EMS/9-1-1. This\naction allows the EMS dispatcher to take down information about the\nemergency and provide it to the trained EMS personnel who will respond\nto the scene. Many EMS dispatchers are also trained to provide first aid\nand CPR instructions over the phone to assist the caller until EMS arrives.\nChain of Survival Behaviours\nThe Chain of Survival Behaviours is a series of steps that help ensure a\npositive outcome for an ill or injured person. As a First Aider, your role is\nto prepare, recognize emergencies, provide first aid and/or access help.\nYour role as a First Aider includes four\nbasic steps:\n1. Recognize the emergency.\n2.

    "content": "Who Is Coming to Help\nEmergency medical services (EMS)\npersonnel have advanced training\nthat allows them to provide medical\ncare outside of the hospital setting.\nDepending on their level of training,\nEMS personnel have different roles and\nresponsibilities. There are different kinds\nof trained personnel who may respond\nwhen a call is placed to EMS/9-1-1.\nFirst Responders: These include police, firefighters, and job-specific\npersonnel such as athletic trainers and workplace first aid response\nteams. They are trained in time-sensitive lifesaving measures. Unlike lay\nresponders (First Aiders), first responders have a legal obligation to act in\nan emergency when they are on duty.\nParamedics: These are highly specialized emergency personnel whose\nskills include both basic and advanced life support. Once on the scene,\nthese professionals will take over the care of the person, including\ntransportation to a hospital or other facility if necessary.Responding to the scene of an emergency involves providing emotional\nsupport as well as caring for injuries. When providing care, you should:\n• Speak in a calm and reassuring manner. Ask for the ill or injured\nperson’s name and use it often.\n• Communicate both verbally and nonverbally to reassure the person.\n• Position yourself at eye level when you talk to the ill or injured\nperson. Avoid unnecessary physical contact and any body language\nthat could appear threatening.\n• Actively listen to the ill or injured person. This involves four\nbehaviours:\n1. Making every effort to fully understand what the person is\ntrying to say.\n2. Repeating back to the person, in your own words, what the\nperson said.\n3. Avoiding criticism, anger, or rejection of the person’s\nstatements.\n4. Using open-ended questions (i.e., avoid questions that can be\nanswered with \"Yes\" or \"No\").\nUnderstanding Your Role in the EMS System\nThe emergency medical services (EMS) system is a network of\nprofessionals linked together to provide the best care for people in all\ntypes of emergencies. As a member of the community, you play a major\nrole in helping the EMS system to work effectively. Your role in the EMS\nsystem includes four basic steps:\n1. Recognizing that an emergency exists\n2. Deciding to help/take action\n3. Activating the EMS system\n4. Giving care until EMS personnel take over\nResponding to Emergencies",

Most people in Canada call\n9-1-1 for help in emergencies, but in some areas of Canada and in many\nworkplaces you may need to dial a different designated emergency\nnumber instead. If you live or work in an area where 9-1-1 is not the\nnumber to call in an emergency, make sure you know the designated\nemergency number to call.\nPhone carriers are required to connect any 9-1-1 call made from a mobile\nphone, even if the phone does not have an active service plan. In most\nareas, you cannot text 9-1-1. Unless you have confirmed that the 9-1-1 call\ncentre in your area supports texting, you should always call.\nWhen to Call EMS/9-1-1\nAt times, you may be unsure whether\nEMS personnel are needed. To make the\ndecision, use your best judgment based\non the situation, your assessment of the\nill or injured person, and information\ngained from this course and other\ntraining you may have received. Trust\nyour instincts. When in doubt, make\nthe call. If you think that an emergency\nexists, it probably does; you should\ncall EMS/9-1-1 for professional help\nimmediately. Call EMS/9-1-1 if there is a danger to you or others, or if the ill or injured\nperson has any of the following conditions:\n• Unresponsiveness or an altered mental state (e.g., confusion)\n• Difficulty breathing or no signs of breathing\n• Persistent chest pain or pressure\n• Life-threatening or uncontrollable bleeding\n• Seizures\n• Severe headaches\n• Abnormal speech\n• Injuries to the head, neck, or back\n• Blood in the vomit or urine\n• An apparent mental health crisis\n• Imminent childbirth\nYou should also call EMS/9-1-1 if the ill or injured person is not easily\naccessible, or if the situation involves any of the following:\n• An explosion\n• A motor vehicle collision\n• Hazardous materials\n• Downed electrical wires\n• Swift-moving water\nPoison Control Centres\nIf none of the conditions above apply and you suspect that poisoning is\nthe cause of the person’s condition, call poison control instead of EMS/9-\n1-1. If any of the above conditions are true (for example, a person who\nmay have swallowed poison is having difficulty breathing), or you are\nunsure of whether to call EMS/9-1-1 or poison control, call EMS/9-1-1.\nActivating EMS\nIn a life-threatening emergency, it is\ncritical that someone activate EMS by\ncalling EMS/9-1-1.

Examples include washing your hands\nfrequently, treating all blood and other bodily fluids as infectious\nmaterials, covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, eating well, and\ngetting enough exercise and sleep.\nOne way to significantly reduce your risk of infection is to inspect your\nhands regularly and cover even small cuts with adhesive bandages. This\nreduces the number of points where germs can enter your body.\nHandwashing\nProper handwashing is an important precaution for preventing\nthe spread of germs that cause many infectious diseases. Frequent\nhandwashing is important as part of a daily routine, for example, before\neating or drinking and after using the washroom.\nWearing gloves helps to protect you from infection, but it does not\neliminate the need for proper hygiene. First Aiders should always wash\ntheir hands thoroughly when they have finished giving care, even if they\nwore gloves the entire time.\nUse the following guidelines when washing your hands:\n1. Always use warm running water\nand a mild soap.2. Create a lather by rubbing\nyour hands together with\nthe soap—friction with the\nsoap suds is what actually\nremoves the germs from\nhands. Rub your hands\ntogether vigorously for at\nleast 30 seconds.\n3. Wash all parts of each\nhand. Be sure to scrub your\npalms and wrists, between\nyour fingers, under your\nfingernails, and around the\nbacks your hands.\n4. Dry your hands with a\nclean paper towel.5.

It is also a good habit to\nwash your hands frequently, for example when returning home from a\npublic place.\nIn a first aid emergency, remember to wash your hands:\n• Before and after contact with an ill or injured person.\n• After handling dirty articles, instruments, or dressings.\n• Before or after treating wounds.\n• After removing gloves.\nHand Sanitizers\nHand sanitizers are not a substitute for hand washing, and are not\nsuitable for cleaning visibly soiled hands. They should be used only as\na temporary measure in situations where you are unable to wash your\nhands immediately. If you can see dirt on your hands, you should wash\nthem with soap and water before using hand sanitizer.\nWhen using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help decontaminate your\nhands, use the amount of product recommended by the manufacturer.\nRub it thoroughly over all the surfaces of your hands, including your nails\nand in between your fingers, until the product dries.\nImmunization\nMost Canadians have been immunized against common diseases such as\nmeasles and tetanus. Some vaccine-preventable diseases are serious, and\ncan lead to disability or death. Immunizations protect not only you, but\nalso your family, friends, and co-workers.Immunization introduces a substance into the body that builds up its\nresistance to germs that cause a specific disease. Some vaccinations\nmay wear away with time. As a result, it’s possible that your immunity\nto a particular disease could decline. It is important to keep up with\nyour immunization needs since protection against diseases through\nimmunization is a lifelong process.\nSome vaccines require more than one injection and a certain period of\ntime between injections. If you are planning a trip outside the country,\nfind out well before you leave which immunizations are recommended\nand required in order to safely go to the countries you will be visiting.\nBecause the risk of disease varies from place to place, this information\ncannot cover all the hazards that you might face. For specific guidelines\non your particular situation, talk to your doctor or your community public\nhealth centre.\nEquipment Precautions\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) is the general term for items that\nprotect you from contact with pathogens and contaminated objects.\nExamples include barrier devices such as safety glasses, goggles, face\nmasks, CPR breathing barriers, and gloves. You should always use some\ntype of barrier device between yourself and any material that could pose\nthe risk of infection.\nAny disposable equipment that you have used (e.g. gloves, breathing\nbarriers) should be immediately disposed of in a labelled leak-proof\ncontainer with a biohazard symbol.\nResponding to Emergencies",

The opening contains a filter or a\nvalve that protects you from coming into contact with the person’s\nbodily fluids and exhaled air.\nBreathing barriers sized specifically for children and babies are available.\nIf possible, select equipment that is appropriately sized for the injured\nor ill person.\nEnvironmental Precautions\nEnvironmental precautions refer to the systems that are implemented\nin an area to reduce exposure to germs. Examples include making sure\nthere is proper ventilation in the workplace, that people don’t use the\nsame sink for hygiene and food preparation, and that any contaminated\nmaterials are immediately disposed of in a dedicated biohazard garbage.\nDesignate a container for sharps (potentially infected sharp objects such\nas used needles and lancets). It should be puncture-resistant, leak-proof,\nand labelled with warning signs such as the biohazard symbol. To avoid\ninfection, put all needles and similar sharp objects into this container\nimmediately after they are used. It should not be used for other\npurposes.Cleaning and Disinfecting\nSurfaces and Equipment\nReusable equipment and surfaces that\nhave been contaminated by blood or\nother potentially infectious materials\nneed to be properly cleaned and\ndisinfected before the equipment is put\nback into service or the area is reopened. Clean and disinfect surfaces\nand equipment as soon as possible after the incident occurs. Remember\nto wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIf blood or other potentially infectious materials have spilled onto the\nfloor or another surface, take steps to prevent unnecessary people from\naccessing the area. If the spill contains sharp objects (e.g., shards of\nbroken glass), do not pick them up with your hands. Instead, use tongs, a\ndisposable scoop and scraper, or two pieces of cardboard to remove and\ndispose of them. Carefully wipe up the spill using absorbent towels, and/\nor use a solidifier (a fluid-absorbing powder).\nAfter cleaning up the spill, flood the area with a freshly mixed\ndisinfectant solution of approximately 1 part bleach to 9 parts water (a\n10% solution). Always ensure that there is good ventilation, and wear\ngloves and eye protection when using bleach. Let the solution stand on\nthe surface for at least 10 minutes, then use clean absorbent materials\n(such as paper towels) to wipe up the liquid and dry the area. Dispose of\nall materials used to clean up the spill in a labelled biohazard container.\nIf a biohazard container is not available, place the soiled materials in a\nsealable plastic bag or a plastic container with a lid, seal the container,\nand dispose of it properly.Many environmental precautions are the responsibility\nof the employer, but you can make suggestions if you\nnotice something that could be improved.\nResponding to Emergencies",

This will form an initial\nimpression. Try to answer these\nquestions:\nIs the scene safe for you, the ill or injured person, and any bystanders?\nEnter a scene only if it is safe to do so. Look for hazards such as spilled\nchemicals, hostile bystanders, or oncoming traffic. Listen for things such\nas ringing alarms or leaking gas. Smell for things such as gas or smoke.\nAvoid entering confined areas with poor ventilation and places where\nthere is a risk of explosion (e.g., from leaking propane or natural gas). Do\nnot enter the scene if the person is hostile or threatening suicide.\nIf hazards are present, stay at a safe distance and call EMS/9-1-1. Leave\ndangerous situations for EMS personnel. Once EMS personnel arrive\nand make the scene safe, you can offer your assistance as appropriate.\nRemember that conditions at the scene may change, so a safe area could\nquickly become dangerous. It is important to continuously monitor your\nsurroundings even if your initial assessment revealed a low level of risk.\nWhat happened? How did it happen?\nTake note of anything that might reveal the cause of the emergency. If\nthe person is unresponsive and there are no witnesses, your check of the\nscene may offer the only clues as to what happened.

If the person is speaking, moaning, or crying, the person’s\nairway is open.\nIf the person is unresponsive, perform a head-tilt/chin-lift.

The person is likely to appreciate your\nconsideration.\nGeneral Tips for Providing First Aid to a Person with a Disability\nRemember the following tips when providing care for a person with any\ntype of disability:\n• As with all first aid, you need permission to help and should explain\nwhat you intend to do. These basic principles do not change\nbecause the person has different abilities.\n• Avoid stereotypes and make no assumptions about what abilities\nthe person has or does not have. Remember that not all disabilities\nare visible.\n• Be confident and reassuring.\n• If you cannot understand what the person is saying, politely ask\nhim or her to repeat it.\n• Don’t touch or speak to service animals. They are working and have\nto pay attention at all times.\n• Get permission before touching assistive devices, including\nwheelchairs.Other causes of shock include the following:\n• Significant blood loss\n• Heart damage\n• Extensive burns\n• Infection\n• Anaphylaxis\n• Severe infection (e.g., septicemia)\nWhat to Look For\nThe following are signs and symptoms of shock:\n• Cool, clammy skin\n• Skin that is paler than normal\n• Weakness\n• Confusion\n• Excessive thirst\n• Rapid breathing\n• Drowsiness or loss of responsiveness\n• Nausea and vomiting\nWhat to Do\nThe best thing you can do when a person is in shock is to call EMS/9-1-1.\nWhile you are waiting for EMS personnel to arrive, provide care by:\n1. Caring for the cause of the shock.\n2. Having the person rest.\n3. Keeping the person warm.\n4. Monitoring the person’s ABCs.\n5. Providing comfort and reassurance.\nCheck, Call, Care",

The best way to do this\nis usually by lightly touching the person’s shoulder or gently waving\nyour hand.\n• Ask the person how you can help. Don’t shout.\n• If communication is difficult, ask if the person prefers to\ncommunicate in another way, such as using a pen and paper.\n• Be patient if you are using a pen and paper to communicate.\nAmerican Sign Language may be the person’s first language and it\nhas its own grammatical rules and sentence structure.\n• If the person uses a hearing aid and you are having trouble\ncommunicating, minimize background noise or move to a quieter\narea, if possible.Providing First Aid for Someone Who Is Deafblind\n\"Deafblind\" describes people who have some degree of both vision\nand hearing loss. Many people who are deafblind are accompanied\nby an intervenor (a professional who helps with communication). If an\nintervenor is accompanying the person, tell him or her who you are, but\nthen speak directly to the ill or injured person. Don’t touch the person\nabruptly and don’t touch the person without permission.\nProviding First Aid for Someone with a Physical Disability\nThere are many different types of physical disability, and not all of\nthem are visible. The important thing is not to diagnose the person:\nwhat matters is determining whether the conditions you encounter are\npre-existing or whether they are signs of the injury or illness you are\nproviding care for.\nKeep the following tips in mind when providing first aid to an individual\nwith a physical disability:\n• Speak naturally to the person (physical and mental disabilities are\nnot the same thing).\n• Adjust your position if necessary so that you can make eye contact\nwith the person while providing care.\nCheck, Call, Care",

Immediate first aid\n(and possibly medical intervention) is required to remove whatever is\nblocking the airway.\nCommon Causes\nAny medical condition that affects a person’s ability to chew and/or\nswallow increases his or her risk of choking. So can dental problems\nor poorly fitting dentures that affect a person’s ability to chew food\nCommon causes of choking include the following:\n• Trying to swallow large pieces of food\n• Eating while talking, laughing, walking, or running\n• Eating too quicklyThe airway is the passage that connects\nthe nose and mouth with the lungs.\nChoking occurs when the airway\nbecomes partially or completely blocked\nby a foreign object (e.g., a piece of food\nor a small toy), by swelling in the mouth\nor throat, or by fluids, such as vomit or\nblood. If the airway is blocked by the\nperson’s tongue or by swelling, this is\ncalled an anatomical obstruction. If it\nis blocked by a physical object, this is\ncalled a mechanical obstruction.\nChildren younger than 5 years old\nhave a particularly high risk of choking\nbecause their airways are about the size\nof their little fingers, but a person of\nany age can choke.\nAnatomy and Physiology\nThe respiratory system consists of the airway and the lungs. When\nbreathing in, air moves from the outside world into the lungs through\nthe airway. The respiratory system constantly supplies the body with\nthe oxygen it needs and removes carbon dioxide. The process is largely\ninvoluntary and is controlled by the brain.\nPartial Choking\nPartial choking happens when the airway is partially blocked. Coughing\nis the body’s way of clearing the airway, and so it may indicate a partial\nairway obstruction. A person who is coughing is still able to breathe.\nSince forceful coughing usually eliminates the obstruction, encourage\nthe person to keep coughing. Stand by and monitor the person in case\nfurther help becomes necessary. Note that the care for complete choking\nwill be ineffective for partial choking, because it depends on creating",

If the person is coughing or can speak, encourage him or her to\ncough forcefully, and do not interfere. Forceful coughing may be\nenough to clear the obstruction on its own.\n2. Encourage or assist the person to sit upright, if possible, as this\nwill make coughing easier and more effective.\n3. Continue to monitor the person’s condition until either the\nobstruction clears itself or the person’s condition worsens.Typical signs of partial choking\ninclude the following:\n• A look of panic, with wide eyes\n• Forceful or weak coughing\n• One or both hands clutching the\nthroat Partial Choking\nWhat To Look For\nIt is not usually necessary to call for help for partial choking, though\nyou may need to do so if the obstruction does not clear or the person’s\ncondition worsens.\nToys smaller than 4 cm (1.5 in.) in\ndiameter are choking hazards for\nbabies and toddlers.

Because every minute counts when a person\nis experiencing a circulation emergency, the person’s survival often\ndepends on First Aiders acting quickly and giving appropriate care until\nEMS personnel arrive and take over.Prevention\nCardiovascular disease has both controllable and uncontrollable factors.\nUncontrollable factors include age, sex, family history, and ethnicity.\nFortunately, many risk factors of cardiovascular disease are the result of\nlifestyle choices and are therefore within a person’s control.\nSmoking is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease,\nbut it is also one of the most controllable factors. Smokers have a\nrisk of sudden death that is 2 to 4 times greater than that of non-\nsmokers. Second-hand and smokeless tobacco also increase the risk of\ncardiovascular disease.\nFortunately, the risk starts to drop as soon as a person stops smoking.\nCompared to a smoker, the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases by half\nwithin 1 year of quitting smoking. Within 15 years, the risk is close to that\nof a non-smoker. Many effective community programs are available for\nindividuals who wish to quit smoking permanently.\nCholesterol\nCholesterol is produced naturally in the body, and is necessary for cellular\nfunction. However, not all cholesterol is good for you: low density\nlipoproteins (LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\") can build up in the bloodstream\nand stick to the blood vessel walls, narrowing the blood vessels and\nreducing blood flow.\nIt is easy to measure cholesterol with a blood test. Cholesterol can be\ncontrolled with a proper diet and exercise, along with medication if\nnecessary. Cardiovascular Disease\nCardiovascular disease is an abnormal\ncondition that affects the heart and\nblood vessels. It is one of the leading\ncauses of death in Canadians, and it is\nthe underlying cause of many circulation\nemergencies.\nAlthough a circulation emergency such\nas angina, a heart attack, or a stroke\ncan occur suddenly, the underlying\ncardiovascular disease often develops\nover a long period of time. In fact, it can\nbegin as early as the teenage years.\nCardiovascular disease occurs when the arteries become hardened and\nnarrowed—a process called atherosclerosis. This damage occurs gradually,\nas cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner\nartery walls. As this buildup worsens, the arteries become narrower,\nreducing the amount of blood that can flow through them. The\nnarrowing of arteries increases the risk of artery blockages, which can\ncause angina, heart attacks, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and strokes.\nCirculation Emergencies50",

Angina causes a painful squeezing, suffocating, or burning feeling\nin the chest.\nUncontrolled high blood pressure, anemia, and certain heart disorders\ncan all contribute to a person’s risk of angina.\nThe signs and symptoms of angina are similar to the signs and symptoms\nof a heart attack, but the pain is usually triggered by physical activity or\nstress, goes away if the person rests, and is often relieved by medication\n(e.g., nitroglycerin). Because it is not possible for First Aiders to\ndistinguish between angina and a heart attack, you should treat a person\nwith angina as you would treat a person having a heart attack.Myth-Information\nMyth: You should delay calling EMS/9-1-1 for a person if you suspect\nthat he or she is experiencing angina and not a full heart attack.\nYou should always call EMS/9-1-1 if you have any reason to suspect that a\nperson might be having a heart attack. It is better to have EMS personnel\narrive at a scene and not be needed than to have a person who is having\na heart attack not receive medical attention.\nMany people who are having a heart attack delay seeking care because\nthey hope they are experiencing signs and symptoms of a more minor\ncondition that will go away with time, such as indigestion, heartburn, a\nmuscle strain, or the flu. People often worry about calling EMS/9-1-1 for a\n\"false alarm.\" Without immediate medical intervention, heart attacks are\noften fatal, so the risk of not seeking care outweighs any inconvenience.\nA stroke happens when the blood\nflow to part of the brain is interrupted,\nresulting in the death of brain cells.\nStrokes can cause permanent brain\ndamage, but with quick action, the\ndamage can sometimes be stopped or\nreversed. Although strokes are most\ncommon in older adults, a person of any\nage, even a child, can have a stroke.Other painkilling medications such as acetaminophen (e.g.,\nTylenol®) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil®) do not have the same\neffect as ASA in reducing damage due to heart attacks. Do\nnot substitute ASA with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\nIf given in conjunction with nitroglycerin, erectile\ndysfunction drugs can cause blood pressure to lower to a\nlife-threatening level. If the person has recently taken an\nerectile dysfunction drug (in the previous 24 to 48 hours),\nadvise the person not to take nitroglycerin.\nCirculation Emergencies53",

When it ruptures, it causes bleeding in the\nsurrounding brain tissues, killing the nearby brain cells and causing a\nAs an intact brain aneurysm usually has no signs or symptoms, it can go\nundetected. However, an unruptured brain aneurysm may press against\nareas in the brain and, depending on the severity of the aneurysm and\nits location, it can cause signs and symptoms such as neck pain, acute\nheadaches, blurred vision, and changes in speech.\nBlood Clot\nAn ischemic stroke occurs when a clot becomes lodged in an artery of the\nbrain, usually because the artery has been narrowed by cardiovascular\ndisease. The blockage prevents blood from reaching the brain cells it\nusually supplies.\nBrain Tumour\nA stroke can also occur when a tumour in the brain presses on an artery.\nThe tumour has a similar effect to a blood clot, resulting in decreased\nblood flow or a complete blockage of blood flow to part of the brain.\nPrevention\nBecause the risk factors for stroke are similar to those for heart disease,\nthe risk of a stroke can be reduced by following the same lifestyle\nchanges discussed for preventing cardiovascular disease.\nWhat to Look For\nThe signs and symptoms of strokes can\nvary from person to person. A person\nwho is having a stroke may suddenly\ndevelop one or more of the following\nsigns and symptoms:\n• A sudden, severe headache\n• Dizziness or confusion\n• Unresponsiveness or temporary loss\nof responsiveness\n• Sudden loss of bladder or\nbowel control\nWhen trying to determine if a person is\nhaving a stroke, remember the acronym\nFACE — Facial numbness or\nweakness, especially on one side.F\nT ARM — Arm numbness or weakness,\nespecially on one side.\nSPEECH — Abnormal speech,\ndifficulty speaking or understanding\nothers, or a loss of speech.\nTIME — Time is important;\ncall EMS/9-1-1 immediately.\nCirculation Emergencies54",

    "content": "Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is also referred to as a \"mini-stroke\" and\nis caused by a temporary drop in blood flow to part of the brain. A TIA\nmay be caused by a tumour or a clot in an artery in the brain. The signs\nand symptoms of a TIA are the same as the signs and symptoms of a\nstroke, but they disappear within a few minutes or hours.\nA person who has had a TIA is at a very high risk of having a stroke in the\nnear future. In fact, more than 10% of people who have a TIA will have\na stroke within 3 months, with half of these strokes happening within 48\nhours of the TIA.\nMyth-Information\nMyth: A person with a suspected stroke does not need medical attention\nif his or her signs and symptoms dissipate.\nTIA signs and symptoms will disappear within a few hours, but the person\nstill needs to be checked by a medical professional. TIAs are warning\nsigns and are often quickly followed by strokes. Always call EMS/9-1-1\nif the person has demonstrated signs and symptoms of a TIA or stroke,\neven if the signs and symptoms have lessened in severity or disappeared\ncompletely.\nLife-Threatening Bleeding\nLife-threatening bleeding refers to a situation where large amounts of\nblood loss occur either externally (outside the body) or internally (within\nthe body). Life-threatening bleeding can occur whenever one or more of\nthe body’s blood vessels are broken. It must be controlled immediately.\nBleeding from arteries (arterial bleeding) is often rapid and profuse, and\nit is always life-threatening. This is because arterial blood is under direct\npressure from the heart, so it usually spurts from the wound, making\nit difficult for clots to form. As a result, arterial bleeding is harder to\ncontrol than bleeding from veins and capillaries.What to Do\n1. Have the person rest in a\ncomfortable position. If the\nperson prefers to lie down, or\nis unresponsive, drooling, or\nhaving trouble swallowing,\nplace the person in the recovery\nCareCall EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.\n2. Note when the signs and symptoms first started (or, if you do not\nknow when the signs and symptoms started, note the last time\nthe person was known to be well).\n3. Monitor the person’s condition and provide reassurance until\nEMS personnel arrive; a stroke can be an extremely frightening\nexperience.\nSome of the medications used to treat strokes can only be\nadministered within a short window of time after the onset\nof signs and symptoms. It is crucial to note when the person\nfirst began to experience the signs and symptoms, or the last\ntime the person was known to be well.\nCirculation Emergencies55",

    "content": "CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation,\nis a skill that is used when a person is\nin cardiac arrest. CPR involves giving\nsets of 30 chest compressions followed\nby sets of 2 rescue breaths; it keeps\noxygenated blood moving to the brain\nand other vital organs until advanced\nmedical help arrives. Because we\nbreathe in 21% oxygen and breathe\nout 16%, even exhaled breath has\nmore than enough to sustain life.\nCardiac Arrest\nCardiac arrest occurs when the heart\nstops beating or beats too ineffectively\nto circulate blood to the brain and\nother vital organs. Under normal\ncircumstances, a network of special cells\nin the heart muscle conducts electrical\nimpulses that coordinate contractions,\ncausing the heart to beat rhythmically.\nIn cardiac arrest, the electrical impulses\nbecome abnormal and chaotic. This\ncauses the heart to lose the ability to\nbeat rhythmically, or to stop beating\naltogether.\nSudden Cardiac Arrest\nCardiac arrest can happen suddenly\nand without any warning signs; this is\ncalled sudden cardiac arrest. People\nwho have a history of cardiovascular\ndisease or a congenital heart disorder\nare at higher risk for sudden cardiac\narrest. However, sudden cardiac arrest\ncan happen in people who appear\nhealthy and have no known heart\ndisease or other risk factors for the\ncondition. A person who experiences\nsudden cardiac arrest is unlikely to\nsurvive without immediate care.\nClinical and Biological Death\nClinical death occurs when breathing\nstops and the heart stops beating. A\nperson without a heartbeat is clinically\ndead. Because permanent brain\ndamage does not begin for 4 to 6\nminutes, clinical death is reversible with\nimmediate care and intervention.\nBiological death occurs when the brain\nbecomes irreversibly damaged, which\noccurs after about 8 to 10 minutes\nwithout oxygen. This is also called\n\"brain death.\" The respiratory and circulatory systems are very closely linked. After\nbreathing stops, it is not long before the heart stops. This is especially\ntrue in children: pediatric cardiac arrests are often the result of airway or\nbreathing emergencies.\nCPR & AED60",

    "content": "CPR Compression Depth for an Adult\nWhen providing CPR to an adult, you should perform compressions in the\nmiddle of the chest on the lower half of the sternum. Push deeply and\npush steadily, ensuring a compression depth of at least 5 cm (about 2 in.),\nwhile avoiding excessive depths greater than 6 cm (about 2.5 in.). While\nthere is a risk of injury with compression depths greater than 6 cm, these\ninjuries tend to be non-life-threatening. It is more important to push\ndeeply and push steadily than to worry about pushing too deeply.\nCPR Compression Depth for a Child or a Baby\nBecause of the variation in size among children or babies, compression\ndepth for this age group is measured as a fraction of the total chest\ndepth, not in centimetres. When providing CPR to a child or baby (i.e.,\na person who has not yet reached puberty), you should perform chest\ncompressions on the lower half of the sternum and depress the chest\nto at least 1/3 of its depth. Ideally, chest compressions should be at the\nupper limit of 1/2 of the front-to-back (anteroposterior) depth.\nCPR compression depths may be impacted by items such as heavy clothing\n(e.g., a winter coat or motorcycle jacket) or sports equipment. You should\nnot delay starting CPR to remove them, but you may have to push harder\nto ensure that the minimum chest compression depth is reached.Chest Compression Rates\nFirst Aiders should perform chest compressions at a rate of 100 to 120\nbeats per minute. Counting out loud as you give compressions can help\nyou to keep a steady, even rhythm that allows time for adequate chest\nrecoil. For compressions one through 12, say \"one and two and three\nand four and five and…\" up to 12. When you get to 13, say the numbers\nwithout saying “and” in between: \"13, 14, 15, 16…\" and so on. Push\ndown as you say the number and come up as you say \"and\" or the second\nsyllable of the number.\nChest Recoil\nYou should avoid leaning on the person’s chest wall in between\ncompressions. Instead, ensure that the chest recoils fully. It is during recoil\nthat the coronary arteries of the heart are filled with blood and the heart\nmuscle gets oxygen. If you are leaning on the person’s chest between\ncompressions, the coronary arteries will not get sufficient blood flow and\nheart death can occur. Remember: Compression is for the brain, recoil is\nfor the heart.\nCPR & AED66",

Incorrect\ntechnique or body position can cause your arms and shoulders to tire\nquickly when you are giving compressions. Avoid rocking back and forth,\nbecause this makes your compressions less effective and wastes your\nDecreasing Compression Fraction (Off-Chest Time)\nDuring CPR, you should minimize interruptions to chest compressions.\nAny interruption decreases the total number of compressions given, and\ntherefore the amount of blood that is circulated. Compressions also build\nup pressure in the person’s arteries: when compressions are interrupted,\nthe arterial pressure drops, which means that the first compressions\nyou give after the interruption are rebuilding the pressure and not yet\ncirculating blood effectively.\nInterruptions should be limited to critical interventions, such as applying\nAED pads to the person, allowing the AED to analyze or administer a\nshock, and clearing the airway. Pause to reassess the person’s ABCs only\nif there has been an obvious change in the person’s condition. Lengthy\nventilation steps (opening airway, excessive breathing) should be\navoided. There is no need for you to reposition your hands after every\ncompression—the hand is placed on the middle of chest.Special Considerations\nCPR for a Pregnant Woman\nWhen performing CPR for a pregnant\nwoman, raising her right hip 7.5 to 10 cm\n(3 to 4 in.) will help blood return to the\nheart. If a bystander is available (or an\nappropriate object is within easy reach),\nask the person to find a soft object that\nyou can place under the woman’s hip,\nbut do not interrupt or delay starting\nCPR to find an object yourself.\nAir in the Stomach\nWhen giving rescue breaths, it is important to keep the person’s head\ntilted back and breathe with just enough force to cause the chest to\nrise. Failing to tilt the head back, giving too much air in one breath, or\nblowing too forcefully can push air into the person’s stomach instead of\ninto his or her lungs.\nAir in the stomach can make someone vomit. When an unresponsive\nperson vomits, the stomach contents may get into the lungs—this is\ncalled aspiration. Aspiration makes giving rescue breaths more difficult\nand reduces the person’s chance of successful resuscitation. To prevent\naspiration, remember to give breaths only until the chest starts to rise.\nIn some situations a person may vomit while you are giving CPR. If this\n1. Turn the person onto his or her side, facing you.\n2. Quickly wipe the person’s mouth clean.\n3. Reposition the person on his or her back and continue with CPR.\nCPR & AED67",

    "content": "Inclement weather: It is safe to use AEDs in all weather conditions,\nincluding rain and snow, but their effectiveness can be reduced if\nthe pads are wet. Provide a dry environment if possible (for example,\nshelter the person with umbrellas), but do not delay defibrillation to\ndo so. An AED is designed to function in a range of weather conditions,\nbut it is still a battery-operated electronic device, and excessive cold,\nheat, moisture, etc., can result in maintenance errors or prevent the\npads from adhering properly. If this happens, move the person into\na different environment, if possible, before attempting defibrillation\nPerson-Specific Considerations\nPregnancy: It is safe to use an AED on a woman who is pregnant.\nPacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): A\nperson who has a known arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) may have a\npacemaker or an ICD. These small devices are surgically implanted under\nthe skin to automatically prevent or correct an irregular heartbeat. You\nmay be able to see or feel the outline of the pacemaker or ICD in the\narea below the person’s collarbone, or the person may wear a medical\nidentification product indicating that he or she has a pacemaker or ICD.\nIf the person has a pacemaker or ICD, adjust the pad placement to avoid\nplacing the AED pads directly over the device, as this can interfere with\nthe delivery of the shock. If you are not sure whether the person has an\nimplanted device, place the pads as you normally would.\nTransdermal medication patches: Some types of medications, including\nnitroglycerin and smoking cessation medications, are delivered through\npatches applied to the skin. Remove any medication patches that you\nsee before applying AED pads. Wear gloves to prevent absorption of\nthe drug through your own skin.\nChest hair: Time is critical in a cardiac arrest situation and sparse chest\nhair rarely interferes with pad adhesion. In most cases, you should\nproceed as you normally would—attach the AED pads, pressing firmly to ensure adhesion. However, if the person has a great deal of thick chest\nhair and it seems like it could interfere with pad-to-skin contact, quickly\nshave the areas where the pads will be placed and then attach the pads.\nJewellery and body piercings: You do not need to remove the person’s\njewellery or body piercings before using an AED. However, if possible,\navoid placing the AED pads directly over any metallic jewellery or\npiercings. If making a small adjustment to pad placement allows you\nto avoid the jewellery then do so, but if you must move the pads\nsignificantly it is better to place the pads directly over the jewellery.\nUsing an AED on a Child or Baby\nThe procedure for using an AED on a child or baby is the same as the\nprocedure for using an AED on an adult. Some AEDs come with pediatric\nAED pads that are smaller and designed to deliver a less powerful shock.\nThese pads should be used on children up to 8 years of age or weighing\nless than 55 pounds. Other AEDs have a key or switch that configures\nthe AED for use on a child. If pediatric AED pads are not available or the\nAED does not have a pediatric setting, it is safe to use the adult pads and\nsetting on a child or baby.\nMedical Direction and AEDs\nIn some professions, defibrillation is designated as a controlled medical\nact. If you are providing care under the authority of a medical director,\nhe or she may choose to adopt different protocols than those of the\nCanadian Red Cross. The specific protocols will be written in a standing\norder. You should always follow the instructions of your medical director.\nThe Canadian Red Cross accepts no responsibility for any modifications\nmade to the AED protocol set out in this text.\nCPR & AED73",

    "content": "AED Maintenance\nAEDs require minimal maintenance, but it is important to check them\nregularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions or your employer’s\npolicy. This ensures that they remain in good working order and are\nready for use whenever they are needed.\nTo ensure that your AED is ready to use:\n• Familiarize yourself with the owner’s manual and follow the\nmanufacturer’s instructions for maintenance.\n• Familiarize yourself with the method the AED uses to indicate\nthe status of the device. Many AEDs have a status indicator that\ndisplays a symbol or illuminates to indicate that the AED is in proper\nworking order and ready to respond. The status indicator may also\ndisplay symbols indicating that routine maintenance is needed\n(e.g., a battery change) or that a problem with the device has been\ndetected. Some AEDs have a warning indicator that will illuminate\nor beep if the AED is not in proper working order or requires\nmaintenance.\n• Check regularly to make sure that the battery is properly installed\nand has not reached its expiration date.\n• Make sure AED pads are adequately stocked, stored in a sealed\npackage, and within their expiration date.\n• After using the AED, make sure that all supplies are restocked and\nthat the device is in proper working order.\n• If at any time the AED fails to work properly or warning indicators\nappear, take the AED out of service and contact the manufacturer\nor the appropriate person at your place of employment (according\nto your employer’s policy). You may need to return the AED to\nthe manufacturer for service. If the AED stops working during an\nemergency, continue giving CPR until EMS personnel take over.Working as a Team\nRemember: when you are giving\nCPR, you want to give high-quality\ncompressions at the appropriate depth\nand rate and to minimize interruptions\nto compressions. If you are the only\ntrained First Aider at the scene, you\nwill begin to tire as you give CPR, and\nthe quality of your compressions will\ndiminish. You will also need to stop CPR\nto ready the AED for use when it arrives,\nwhich means that during that time there\nwill be no oxygenated blood moving\nthrough the person’s body.\nWorking as a team can increase the chance of survival for the person\nin cardiac arrest. First Aiders can share the responsibility for giving\ncompressions, switching off every 2 minutes. This reduces fatigue and\nleads to higher-quality compressions.\nHaving two or more First Aiders at the scene also minimizes interruptions\nto chest compressions when the AED arrives. One First Aider should begin\nCPR while the second calls EMS/9-1-1, obtains the AED, and readies it for\nuse by turning the device on, applying the pads to the person’s chest, and\nplugging in the connector cable, if necessary. The First Aider performing\nCPR should not pause CPR until the AED is ready to analyze the person’s\nheart rhythm and the second First Aider tells everyone to stand clear.\nWhile the AED is analyzing, the First Aiders should switch roles. The\nFirst Aider who is taking over compressions should hover with his or her\nhands positioned just above the person’s chest so that he or she can\nimmediately start compressions as soon as the AED prompts that a shock\nwas delivered or that no shock was advised. The First Aiders then switch\nroles every time the AED analyzes the person’s heart rhythm, which\noccurs every 2 minutes.\nCPR & AED74",

Both respiratory\ndistress and respiratory arrest are\nbreathing emergencies. Respiratory\ndistress is especially dangerous in\nchildren, as it can quickly lead to cardiac\narrest. Any child showing signs of\nrespiratory distress is in a potentially\nlife-threatening situation and must\nreceive immediate care.\nWhen a person is experiencing a breathing emergency, the oxygen\nsupply to the person’s body is either greatly reduced or cut off entirely,\nso it is important to act at once. If breathing stops or is restricted long\nenough, the person will become unresponsive, the heart will stop\nbeating, and body systems will quickly fail.

If you hyperventilate\ndue to a diagnosed medical condition, speaking to your doctor will help\nyou learn how to treat or control it.\nWhat to Look ForCall\nCall EMS/9-1-1.\n1. If the person carries medication for respiratory distress, offer to\nhelp the person take his or her medication.\n2. Encourage the person to sit down in a comfortable position\n(leaning forward may help make breathing easier).\n3. Provide reassurance, as this can help reduce anxiety and help the\nperson control his or her breathing.\n4. Monitor the person’s condition and provide continual care until\nEMS personnel arrive.The following are signs and symptoms of hyperventilation:\n• Rapid, shallow breathing\n• A feeling of suffocating or not getting enough air\n• Fear, anxiety, or confusion\n• A feeling of dizziness\n• Numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes\n• Muscle contractions, usually in the hands, feet, arms, and legs\nWhat to Do\nIt is not always necessary to call EMS/9-1-1 for a person who is\nhyperventilating. You should call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED if the\nhyperventilation does not stop after a few minutes, the person becomes\nunresponsive, or you suspect that the person is hyperventilating because\nof an injury or illness.\n1.

The best way to treat hyperventilation is to\nencourage the person to take slow, controlled breaths.\nMany people have asthma—a chronic\nillness in which certain substances\nor conditions (i.e., triggers) cause\ninflammation and swelling of the\nbronchioles (i.e., the small tubes at the\nbase of the lungs), making it harder\nfor air to move in and out of the lungs.\nAsthma is more common in children.\nPeople who have asthma usually\nknow what can trigger an attack and\ntake measures to avoid these triggers.\nAsthma is usually controlled with\nmedication.\nCommon Causes\nAsthma can be triggered by:\n• Air pollution or poor air quality (e.g., cigarette smoke)\n• Allergies (e.g., to pollen, food, drugs, insect stings, or animals)\n• Temperature fluctuations, extreme humidity, or extreme dryness\n• Strong odours (e.g., perfume, cologne, scented cleaning products)\n• Colds and flus\n• Physical activity\n• Respiratory infections\n• Stress or anxietyPrevention\nIf you have asthma, the following precautions may help to prevent attacks:\n• Know what triggers your attacks and avoid them if possible.\n• Ensure that prescribed medication is always easily accessible in case of\nan attack.\nIf a child has asthma:\n• Make sure that anyone who supervises the child knows about the\nasthma and how to help give medication if necessary.\nAsthma Medications\nThere are two main types of medication used by people with asthma:\nLong-term control medication and quick-relief (rescue) medication. A\nperson with asthma may take one, both, or neither of them. Both long-\nterm control medications and quick-relief (rescue) medications may be\ngiven through an inhaler, through a nebulizer, or orally.\nLong-term control medications, sometimes\ncalled \"preventers,\" are taken regularly,\nwhether or not signs and symptoms of\nasthma are present. These medications\nhelp prevent asthma attacks by reducing\ninflammation and swelling and by making\nthe bronchioles less sensitive to triggers.\nQuick-relief (rescue) medications are\ntaken when a person is experiencing an\nacute asthma attack. These medications\nare sometimes called \"bronchodilators,\"\nbecause they work quickly to relax\nthe muscles that tighten around the\nbronchioles, opening (dilating) them\nimmediately so that the person can breathe\nmore easily. 7878\nBreathing Emergencies78",

Otherwise, try to control the bleeding with\npressure on the area around the wound.\n4. Provide continual care until EMS personnel arrive.\nPrevention\nThe following general tips help to minimize the risk of infection:\n• Always wash your hands before and after giving first aid.\n• Wear gloves whenever possible if you will be coming into contact\nwith someone’s bodily fluids.\n• Keep your immunizations up to date. If you have been wounded\nand do not know when your last tetanus shot was, seek medical\nattention.\n• Keep any wound clean and wash it regularly. Change the dressing\nand bandages if they become dirty or wet.\n• Use sterile dressings whenever possible. If sterile dressings are\nunavailable, use the cleanest option possible.\nWound Care89",

    "content": "When to Move a Person with a Head, Neck, or Spinal Injury\nYou may need to move a person with a head, neck, and/or spinal injury in\nthe following situations:\n• The person’s airway is blocked (for example, if the person vomits)\n• The scene of the emergency becomes dangerous\n• There is no organized EMS response in the region (for example, if\nthe injury occurs in a very remote area)\nWhen moving the person, try to keep the head, neck, and spine in the\nposition you found them. Avoid unnecessary jostling and move the\nperson only as much as is necessary.\nRemember, it is more important to treat life-threatening conditions than\nit is to keep the person still. If the person has a potential spinal injury and\nis not breathing, opening the airway and starting CPR immediately are\nmore important than protecting the spine from further damage.A concussion can result from even a seemingly minor bump, blow, or jolt,\nand may be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms may\nnot be immediately obvious. Concussions are evolving injuries, with the\neffects intensifying, dissipating, or changing unexpectedly in the days\nand weeks following the event of the injury. Depending on the severity\nof the concussion, signs and symptoms can last for days, weeks, or even\nmonths. The majority of concussions, however, resolve in a short period\nIt is not fully known exactly what happens to brain cells in a concussion,\nbut a change in the brain’s chemical function seems to be involved in\nthe process. As a result, concussions are rarely visible in neuroimaging\nscans. The exact duration of this altered function is not yet known, but\nduring the recovery period the brain is more susceptible to further injury.\nA person who has had one concussion is at increased risk for future\nconcussions. As a result, it is critical that as soon as someone is suspected\nof having a concussion, they are removed from activity and seek care\nfrom a qualified medical professional. A person does not need to become\nunresponsive to have incurred a concussion.\nCommon Causes\nA concussion may be caused by:\n• A blunt force to the head or jaw\n• An explosion\n• Whiplash\n• A forceful blow to the body\n• Shaking (in the case of a baby)\nConcussion\nA concussion is a subset of traumatic\nbrain injuries (TBI) that involve a\ntemporary alteration in brain function.\nAn impact to the head or upper body\ncan create forces that cause the brain\nto \"shake\" inside the skull. This shaking\ncan cause the brain to collide with the\nbony structures that make up the skull’s\ninner shell (sometimes causing swelling\nand/or bleeding), or to rotate within the\nskull, which can shear or tear the brain\nnerve fibres and sometimes stretch and\ndamage the brain cells.\nHead, Neck, and Spinal Injuries112",

There may also be personal or external\npressures to continue participating in the activity at hand (e.g., workplace\nrequirements, social events, or sporting activities), instead of avoiding\nsuch aggravating factors. Continued participation in activities that\nprovoke symptoms during either the acute or the recovery stage can re-\naggravate the condition due to raised levels of exertion. To avoid this, it\nis important that the person seek medical attention following a blow to\nthe head, neck, or upper body with any concussion symptoms. Cessation\nof physical activity and the promotion of cognitive rest (reducing \"screen\ntime\" and other activities that require concentration) are critical to the\nresolution of concussion injuries.\nConcussion Signs and Symptoms in Children and Babies\nIdentifying signs and symptoms of a concussion in a child is more difficult\nthan for an adult. It is particularly difficult for a child or baby, since the\nchild or baby may not be able to speak to describe the symptoms. In\naddition to the standard signs of a concussion, the child or baby may\nexhibit the following signs, which are more specific to this age group:\n• Disturbed sleeping and eating patterns\n• Excessive crying\n• Disinterest in activities or favourite toys\nChildren may also express simply \"feeling off\" or \"not feeling right\"\nfollowing a physical impact. This is also a possible symptom of a\nconcussion.What to Do\nCall EMS/9-1-1 if the person has the following more severe signs and\nsymptoms of a concussion:\n• Repeated or projectile vomiting\n• Loss of responsiveness of any duration\n• Lack of physical coordination (e.g., stumbling and unusual clumsiness)\n• Confusion, disorientation, or memory loss\n• Changes to normal speech\n• Seizures\n• Vision and ocular changes (e.g., double vision, dilated pupils, or\nunequal pupil size)\n• Persistent dizziness or loss of balance\n• Weakness or tingling in the arms or legs\n• Severe or increasing headacheCall\nIf you think a person has sustained a concussion, advise the person to\nstop the activity he or she was engaged in when the incident occurred.\nIf the person sustains an injury that causes a jolt or blow to the head or\nbody, and then displays any signs and symptoms of a concussion, you\nshould assume that a concussion has occurred. The person should follow\nup with a qualified healthcare provider as soon as possible for a full\nevaluation. A healthcare provider is best able to evaluate the severity\nof the injury and make recommendations about when the person can\nreturn to normal activities. While rare, permanent brain damage and\ndeath are potential consequences of failing to identify and respond to a\nconcussion in a timely manner. Prompt recognition of when a potential\nconcussion injury has occurred, immediate removal from the activity, and\nappropriate follow-up care are key elements in preventing catastrophic\nconsequences.114114\nHead, Neck, and Spinal Injuries114",

These people can also have a positive impact on\nconcussion recovery by supporting the person and encouraging him or\nher to follow the concussion recovery plan outlined by the doctor.\nProper management of the person’s signs and symptoms by a qualified\nhealthcare provider will help to avoid future problems that may lead to\npermanent issues and a diminished quality of life. If treated improperly,\nconcussions can cause a wide range of functional long-term changes\naffecting thinking, sensation, language, and/or emotions. Concussions\ncan also cause long-term neurological conditions, such as seizure\ndisorders, and, in the most severe cases, death.\nShaken Baby Syndrome\nShaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) refers to a variety of injuries that may result\nwhen a baby or a young child is violently shaken. This causes the brain\nto move within the skull, forcing blood vessels to stretch and tear. SBS is\nmost associated with babies and toddlers, but can occur in children up to\n5 years old.\nSBS is the most common cause of mortality in babies. It is the most\nfrequent cause of long-term disability in babies and young children, and\nit can cause permanent brain damage. SBS differs from other forms of\nphysical abuse in that it is frequently a single event and there may be no\nobvious sign of injury.\nOften there is no intent to harm the baby. Inconsolable crying is the\nmost common trigger that leads a person to shake a baby. When trying\nto console a crying baby, never shake the baby, no matter what. Instead,\nplace the baby face-up in a safe place and let the baby cry. Take a few\ndeep breaths and then try again to soothe the baby. Other common\ntriggers are feeding problems and difficulties with toilet training.\nFeelings of anger and frustration can be overwhelming. However,\nshaking a child or baby is never appropriate. If you feel like you might\nlose control, stop! Take a break, never shake. Place the child in a safe Anyone who exhibits more concerning signs and symptoms requires\nimmediate medical evaluation. An injury that causes a concussion may\nalso trigger bleeding in or around the brain, leading to symptoms like\nextended drowsiness and confusion. This type of bleeding can be life-\nthreatening. The person must be monitored in the immediate hours after\nthe injury to ensure that the symptoms do not progress or worsen, as this\ncan indicate additional brain injuries that require emergency care.\nMyth-Information\nMyth: A person with a concussion who falls asleep could die.\nIt is generally considered safe for a person with a concussion to go to\nsleep. However, the person’s healthcare provider may recommend that\nyou wake the person periodically to make sure that his or her condition\nhas not worsened.\nFollow-Up Care for Concussions\nIt is important that the person seek medical advice from a doctor, ideally\none who specializes in concussions, since signs and symptoms can escalate\nin the days or weeks following the injury. A person who has suffered a\nconcussion should not participate in any physical activities until a doctor\ngives permission to do so. Activities that require concentration (e.g.,\nreading) and visual stimulation, such as working on a computer, texting,\netc. should also be reduced to allow the brain the opportunity to recover\nfrom cognitive stressors. When given permission from a doctor, it is\nimportant to resume all of these activities gradually and be monitored by\na medical professional.\nA person recovering from a concussion may not be able to effectively\nmonitor his or her own symptoms, and may not make the best decisions\nabout things like rest, sleep, and limiting visual stimulation. It is crucial\nthat the person’s family members, caregivers, friends, or colleagues note\nany changes in his or her sleep habits or physical, cognitive, or emotional\nbehaviour, as any of these can indicate that the recovery phase has 115115\nHead, Neck, and Spinal Injuries115",

    "content": "Bone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries10\n\nBones are strong, hard, dense, tissues that come in many different sizes\nand shapes. More than 200 bones make up the skeleton, creating the\nframework for the body. Muscles are soft tissues that can contract and\nrelax. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by\ntendons and move the body when they receive signals from the brain. A\njoint is formed where two or more bones are held together by ligaments\nthat allow movement.\nBones, muscles, and joints have many jobs:\n• Supporting the body\n• Protecting internal organs\n• Allowing movement\n• Storing minerals\n• Producing blood cells\n• Producing heat through movement\nThere are four basic types of bone, muscle, and joint injuries:Dislocation: Occurs when the bones that\nmeet at a joint move out of their normal\nposition. This type of injury is usually caused\nby a violent force that tears the ligaments,\nallowing the bones to move out of place.\nSprain: Occurs when a ligament is stretched,\ntorn, or damaged. Ligaments connect\nbones together at the joints. Sprains most\ncommonly affect the ankle, knee, wrist, and\nfinger joints.Muscle Cramps\nA muscle cramp is a painful condition that can be caused by heavy\nexercise or staying in the same position for too long. You can usually stop\nthe pain by stretching and massaging the area with the cramp, resting, or\nchanging position.\nCommon Causes\nBone, muscle, and joint injuries can occur in many ways. The causes\ninclude the following:\n• Awkward or sudden movements\n• Direct blows to the body\n• Repetitive actions or forces, such as joggingStrain: Occurs when a tendon or muscle\nis stretched, torn, or damaged. Tendons\nconnect muscles to bones. Strains are\noften caused by overworking a muscle\n(e.g., by lifting an overly heavy object or by\nrepetitively performing the same action).\nThey usually involve the muscles in the neck,\nback, thigh, or the back of the lower leg. Fracture: A complete break, chip, or crack in\na bone. Fractures can be open (if the end of\nthe broken bone breaks through the skin)\nor closed (the broken bone does not break\nthrough the skin). Open fractures are also\ncalled \"compound fractures.\"\nBone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries118",

Children should learn\ntheir limits and rest when they are too tired or frustrated to\ncontinue safely.\nFalls are the leading cause of injuries among the elderly. Reduce the risk\nwith safety measures such as:\n• Good lighting.\n• Sturdy railings on staircases.\n• Non-slip floors and rugs.\nThe signs and symptoms of bone, muscle,\nand joint injuries may include the\nfollowing:\n• Pain, deformity, swelling, or\n• Limited or no use of the injured\n• A broken bone or bone fragments\nsticking out of the skin\n• A sensation or sound of bones\n• Possible muscle cramps\n• The sound of a snap or a pop when\nthe injury happened\nWhat to Do\nThe person may be anxious and in a lot of pain. In most cases, the best\nthing that you can do is keep the person comfortable and prevent further\ninjury until the person receives medical attention. To avoid damaging\nnerves, blood vessels, and tissues, do not perform traction or any other\nmanipulation.\nWhen caring for an open fracture, your first priority is to stop any\nbleeding. Provide care as you would for any other open wound.\nBone, muscle, and joint injuries range from very minor to life-threatening,\nso you must determine whether there is a need to call EMS/9-1-1.

Applying heat causes\nthe blood vessels in the area to dilate (widen), bringing more blood to\nthe area and increasing swelling. Cold, on the other hand, causes blood\nvessels to constrict (narrow), reducing blood flow to the area and helping\nto reduce swelling. In addition, applying cold slows the nerve impulses\nand helps to reduce pain.\nTreat the injury using the RICE method:\nSplinting Guidelines\nSplinting involves securing an injured bone or joint to keep it from\nmoving, which reduces the risk of further injury and helps reduce pain.\nHowever, you should apply a splint only if you must move a person to get\nmedical help or if the EMS response will be delayed.\nCommon items such as rolled newspapers, scarves, belts,\nand pillows can be used to improvise slings and splints if\ncommercial versions are not available. Medical tape and\nmedical braces can also be used to support strains and sprains. REST — Have the person stop any current activities and rest\nwithout moving or straightening the injured body part.R\nE IMMOBILIZE — If you need to move the person or if EMS\nresponse will be delayed, immobilize the injured area in the\nposition in which it was found by creating a splint. Otherwise\nkeep the person still and do not splint the injury.\nCOOL — If it does not cause the person any discomfort, cool\nthe injured area for 20 minutes of every hour to reduce swelling\nand pain. The part should be cooled for 20 minutes of every\nhour for up to 48 hours. Do not rub the ice or cold pack on the\ninjured area. If you use ice, put some sort of thin, dry cloth or\npad between it and the person’s bare skin to avoid freezing the skin.\nELEVATE — Keep the injured area above the level of the\nheart, if possible. However, do not raise the injured area if\nmoving it will cause pain. 120120\nBone, Muscle, and Joint Injuries120",

In most cases, these seizures are non-life-threatening and do\nnot last long.\nTo reduce the risk of febrile seizures in a child or baby with a high fever,\nyou must lower his or her body temperature:Mental Health Crisis\nMental health first aid is the initial\ncare given by a First Aider to a person\nin a mental health crisis. Like any first\naid, it includes the recognition of\nsigns and symptoms and the care that\ncan be given until either appropriate\nprofessional follow-up care is received\nor the crisis is resolved.\nCall EMS/9-1-1 for a febrile seizure if:\n• It is the first time that the child or baby has had a febrile seizure.\n• The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or is repeated.\n• The seizure is followed by a quick increase in body temperature.\nA First Aider is not a therapist, but rather a listener.

Offer self-help strategies such\nas breathing exercises.Call\nCall EMS/9-1-1 immediately if you suspect that the person poses a risk to\nyou or others, or that the person is contemplating suicide or other self-\nharm. If you are aware of support systems that are in place for the person,\ncontact them as well.\nSelf-Inflicted Injuries\nSelf-harm ranges from minor self-inflicted injuries to suicide. Suicide is\none of the ten most common causes of death in Canada, affecting people\nfrom a variety of backgrounds and age groups. Anyone expressing\nintentions of self-harm requires immediate intervention, and therefore\nEMS/9-1-1 must always be called.\nPossible indicators of self-harm include the following:\n• A person expressing negative (especially suicidal) thoughts and\ncomments about him-or herself\n• A person expressing his or her intent to die, especially if he or she\nhas a plan to do so\n• A person expressing his or her final wishes to someone close by (e.g.,\na bystander at scene)\n• Items associated with a suicide attempt found at the scene (e.g., a\ngun, sleeping pills)\nChildbirth\nYou may find yourself in the position\nof helping a pregnant woman who\nis in labour. Childbirth is a natural\nprocess and the woman’s body knows\nwhat to do: Your primary role will be\nto provide comfort and reassurance\nand to facilitate the process while you\nwait for EMS personnel to arrive. The\nlabour and delivery process will happen\nwithout much intervention on your part.\nRemember, the woman who is pregnant\ndelivers the baby. Be patient and let the\nbirth happen naturally.\nSudden Medical Emergencies133",

The heat produced by\nroutine activities such as walking is usually enough to balance normal\nheat loss.\nThe Hypothalamus and Body Temperature\nThe hypothalamus is the part of the brain that controls\nthermoregulation, which is the body’s ability to maintain a temperature\nthat is within the ideal range. The hypothalamus gets temperature\ninformation from the skin and central receptors. If the body is too warm,\nthermoregulatory \"heat loss\" responses include increasing the skin’s\nblood flow and/or sweating to facilitate evaporation. If the body is too\ncold, responses include decreasing the skin’s blood flow and shivering,\nwhich produces heat by contracting and relaxing muscles.\nEnvironmental Illness137",

Heat loss due to direct contact with cold snow\ncould be decreased by minimizing contact or increasing insulation\n(e.g., sitting on an insulated pad on the snow).\n3.

Sweating occurs\nwhen either the skin and/or body core temperatures increase. In\na cold environment, sweating should be minimized (e.g., layers of\nclothing should be removed before or during hard work). In a hot\nenvironment, evaporative heat loss is beneficial.

It results when at least one of the four mechanisms\nthat cool the body is impaired by clothing, drugs, or disease, or is\noverwhelmed by internal heat production and/or external heat exposure.\nHeat-related illnesses will get worse without treatment and can change\nfrom one level to another very quickly.\nPrevention\nOne of the most important actions a person can take to prevent heat-\nrelated illnesses is to drink plenty of fluids. You should drink eight 250 mL\n(8 oz.) glasses of fluid a day for low-exertion, routine activities and more\nas exertion levels increase. It is important to rehydrate regularly during\nlonger events. If you feel thirsty, you are already dehydrated, so develop\nthe habit of drinking fluids regularly rather than waiting for the warning\nsigns of dehydration to appear.\nThe following tips will also help to prevent heat-related illness:\n• Maintain a healthy level of cardiovascular fitness.\n• Prior to a major event in the heat, let the body gradually acclimatize\nby being exposed to 1 to 2 hours of heat exertion for at least 8 days.\n• Avoid being outdoors during the hottest part of the day.\n• Reduce the intensity of activities as it gets hotter and don’t work or\nexercise for too long at a time.\n• Take frequent breaks in a cool or shaded area to cool off. This will\nhelp the body cope with short periods of extreme heat.\n• Dress for the heat and for the intended activity.\n• Make adjustments to exertion levels and work/rest cycles on hot\ndays (e.g., schedule football practices for cooler parts of the day).\n• Wear a light hat when under the sun. Wear loose-fitting light\nclothing that allows liquid and vapour to escape.\n• Choose hydrating drinks, such as water or juice, over dehydrating\nones like alcohol.Environmental Physical Behavioural\n• Heat waves,\nespecially if there\nhasn’t been one\nin recent years\n• High humidity\n(above 75%),\nwhich decreases\nthe ability\nof sweat to\nevaporate• Age: Babies,\nchildren, and the\nelderly are less\nable to sweat and\nadjust to changes\nin temperature\n• Body size and\nmass: Larger\nbodies with more\nfat tissue retain\nheat and warm up\nmore quickly\n• Clothing that\nprevents the\nloss of heat and\nmoisture (e.g.,\nfootball padding)\n• Chronic illness\n• Heart disease\n• Skin, hormone, or\nnervous system\n• Poor physical\nfitness• Working or\nexercising too\nmuch in hot\n• Not drinking\nenough fluids to\nreplace the water\nlost by sweating\n(dehydration)\n• Drinking too\nmuch alcohol in\nhot weather\n• Taking stimulants\nsuch as cocaine or\namphetamines\n• Salt depletion\n• FatigueCOMMON CAUSES OF ENVIRONMENTAL ILLNESS\nEnvironmental Illness139",

Gently stretch and massage the cramped muscles.\nWhen the cramps stop, the person can usually resume his or her activity\nas long as there are no other signs or symptoms of illness.Myth-Information\nMyth: When a person has heat cramps, you should give salt tablets\nto replenish lost sodium.\nSalt tablets are not an effective treatment for heat cramps. Consuming\na concentrated form of salt can actually promote loss of fluid from the\nbody, which will make the person’s condition worse instead of better.\nHeat Exhaustion\nHeat exhaustion occurs when the body\nbegins to overheat, especially when\nit loses more fluids and electrolytes\nthrough sweating than it gains through\nrehydration. It usually happens after\nlong periods of strenuous activity in a\nhot environment, especially if it is humid or lacking in air circulation, as\nthese conditions make it difficult for sweat to evaporate.\nHeat exhaustion is an early indicator that the body’s temperature-\nregulating mechanisms are being overwhelmed. As more blood flows to\nthe skin to remove heat from the body’s core, not enough blood flows to\nthe vital organs. This causes a mild form of shock. Heat exhaustion can\nprogress to heat stroke, so monitor the person’s condition carefully.\nEnvironmental Illness140",

    "content": "Cold-Water Immersion\nCold-water immersion can occur\nin open water (e.g., when a boat\ncapsizes) or after breaking through\nthe ice. Although hypothermia occurs\nfaster in cold water than cold air,\nthe signs, symptoms, and care are\nessentially the same.\nCold-water immersion has four distinct phases:\n1. Cold-Shock Response: Rapid cooling of the skin causes a gasp\nfollowed by hyperventilation (lasting 1 to 2 minutes).\n2. Cold Incapacitation: Further cooling of nerve and muscle\nfibres causes weakness and a loss of coordination, leading to\nincapacitation within approximately 15 minutes.\n3. Hypothermia: A person dressed appropriately for the weather\nconditions will take 30 minutes or more to become mildly\nhypothermic.\n4. Circum-Rescue Collapse: Can occur just prior to, during, or after\nrescue. The signs and symptoms range from collapsing, to fainting,\nto cardiac arrest. When rescuing a person from cold water, monitor\nthe person’s condition carefully and be prepared to provide\nemergency care.\nMost deaths in cold water result from the Cold-Shock Response (when\nthe head is under water) or drowning due to Cold Incapacitation. A\nproperly worn personal flotation device (PFD) will keep a person afloat\nafter he or she loses the ability to swim during the Cold Incapacitation\nphase.What to Do (Rescue)\nSelf-Rescue\n1. If you are in open water, do a self-rescue by getting into a boat,\nraft, or other mode of marine transportation, if available.\n2. If you have fallen through the ice, place your arms on the surface\nof the ice, kick your legs until your body is horizontal to the\nwater’s surface, and then kick and pull forward until you are on\nthe ice. Roll away from the hole before standing up.\nSurvive to Await Rescue\nIf you are in open water and self-rescue is not possible, increase your\nsurvival time by doing the following:\n1. Get out of the water as much as possible by using a capsized\nboat or other floating object as a flotation device.\n2. If you are wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), adopt the\nHeat Escape Lessening Position (HELP):\n• Press your arms against your armpits.\n• Place your forearms across your chest.\n• Squeeze your thighs together and raise your knees toward\nyour chest.\n3. If several people are together, adopt the HUDDLE position:\n• Face each other.\n• Have each person squeeze his or her thighs together.\n• Form a circle and hug each other. Each person should\nplace one arm above and one arm below the arms of those\nadjacent, and pull the sides of the chests together.\n• Sandwich any children or persons without a PFD inside the\nHUDDLE.151151\nEnvironmental Illness151",

Talk – Instruct the person on\nself-rescue.\n2. Throw – Throw a rope or\nbuoyant object to the person.\n3. Reach – Reach out to the\nperson with a rigid object\nlike a ladder, paddle, or tree\nAny person rescued from cold water should be treated for hypothermia.\nUnless you have received specific training in water\nrescue, never enter the water or approach a hole in the\nice to attempt to help a person.Prevention\nThe following tips will reduce the risk of drowning:\n• Always wear a personal flotation device (PFD) when in a boat or\nother mode of marine transportation.\n• Supervise children in, on, and around any body of water.\n• Those who do not swim or are weak swimmers should wear a PFD\nwhen in, on, and around any body of water.\n• Check water depth before swimming or diving.\n• Have appropriate safety equipment available when in or on the\n• Take Canadian Red Cross Swimming and Water Safety lessons.\nResponsive Drowning Person\nWhat to Look for\nDrowning occurs when a person’s airway is submerged in water, cutting\noff the oxygen supply to body.\nDrowning is a leading cause of death for children and babies. An average\nof 400 Canadians drown each year. Young children aged 1 to 4 and men\naged 15 to 44 are at the greatest risk.These common warning signs can indicate that someone is drowning:\n• The person is vertical in the water, and is not using his or her legs to\nmove forward or tread water.\n• The person may have an expression of fear.\n• The person’s arms may be flailing up and down as he or she tries to\nrise out of the water to breathe, rather than trying to swim forward.\n• The person’s movements are uncontrolled.\nEnvironmental Illness152",

    "content": "A poison is a substance that has a harmful effect within the body if it\nis inhaled, swallowed (ingested), absorbed, or injected. Poisons are\nimmediately life-threatening if they affect breathing or circulation.\nPractically anything can be a poison if it is not meant to be taken into the\nbody. Even some substances that are meant to be taken into the body,\nsuch as medications, can be poisonous if they are taken by the wrong\nperson, or if the person takes too much. Combining certain substances\ncan also result in poisoning.\nPoisoning can happen anywhere, but most poisonings take place in the\nhome. Children younger than 5 years, especially toddlers, are at the\nhighest risk for poisoning. Children may be attracted to pretty liquids\nin bottles, sweet-smelling powders, berries on plants that look like they\nare edible, or medications or vitamins that look like candy. Additionally,\nvery young children explore their world by touching and tasting things\naround them, so even substances that do not look or smell attractive are\npoisoning hazards among this age group. Older adults who have medical\nconditions that cause confusion (such as dementia) or who have impaired\nvision are also at a higher risk of unintentional poisoning.\nWhen providing first aid for a poisoned person, use caution to avoid\ncontact with the poison.\nYour local Poison Control Centre can provide you with specific first\naid instructions for a variety of types of poison, but remember that\nyou should always call EMS/9-1-1 if the person has an altered level of\nresponsiveness or is having difficulty breathing. Keep the local Poison\nControl Centre number by your telephone and save it as a contact in your\nmobile phone.Swallowed Poison\nEnters the body through the mouth, lips,\nesophagus, or stomach. Drinking bleach\nis an example of swallowed poisoning.\nAbsorbed Poison\nEnters the body through the skin. Plants\n(such as poison ivy) and chemicals can\ncause absorbed poisoning.\nInjected Poison\nEnters the body through bites or stings or\nas drugs injected with a needle.\nInhaled Poison\nIs breathed into the body. Breathing in\ncarbon monoxide from a car’s exhaust is\nan example of inhaled poisoning.TYPES OF POISONS\nPoisons155",

CO\npoisoning is often called a \"silent killer\" because it is not detectable to\nany of the body’s senses. CO bonds to red blood cells 200 times better\nthan oxygen, preventing oxygen from attaching and therefore starving\nthe body of oxygen.\nIt releases when fuel is burned in small engines, lanterns, fireplaces,\nstoves, grills, gas ranges, furnaces, cars, and trucks. When equipment that\nburns these fuels is properly ventilated, CO poisoning is not a problem.\nBut if the equipment or ventilation system is faulty, or if outdoor\nequipment is used in an enclosed area, toxic levels of CO can build up\nquickly, creating the risk of CO poisoning. Concentrated CO is poisonous\nand life-threatening to those who inhale it.\nPrevention\nThe following tips help prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning:\n• Ensure that a battery-operated or battery back-up CO detector is\ninstalled in the home or workplace where the alarm will be easily\n• Check the CO detector’s batteries twice a year, ideally once in the\nfall and once in the spring.\n• Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment installed and repaired\nby a qualified technician.\n• Have all fuel-based appliances and equipment serviced annually by a\nqualified professional.\n• Use fuel-based appliances and materials as intended (e.g., do not use\ngenerators or portable flameless chemical heaters indoors, do not\nuse a gas stove or oven for heating, do not burn charcoal indoors).\n• Ensure that chimneys are inspected and cleaned annually by a\nprofessional.\n• Never run a car or truck inside an attached garage. For detached\ngarages, always leave the garage door open when running a car or\ntruck inside.\nThe following may indicate that a\npoisonous substance has been inhaled:\n• Breathing difficulties\n• Irritated eyes, nose, or throat\n• Dizziness\n• Vomiting\n• Seizures\n• Bluish colour around the mouth\n• Unresponsiveness\n• An unusual smell in the air\nWhat to Do\nIf the person is responsive and alert and his or her ABCs are unaffected,\ncall the local Poison Control Centre.

If the person is unresponsive but is breathing, and if you\nhave received training in its use, give the person naloxone by\nfollowing the instructions on the label. Always follow specific\npolicies and the training you have received in providing\n3. Stay with the person and provide continual care until EMS\npersonnel arrive. Ensure that the person receives professional\nmedical care, as naloxone alone is not enough to care for a\nperson who has overdosed on opioids.\nAdministering naloxone requires special training. If you are trained and\nnaloxone is available, you can give naloxone to someone suffering from\nan opioid drug overdose, as this is an effective and lifesaving treatment.\nWhat to Look For\nWhat to Do\nCall EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED.Care\nAlcohol Poisoning\nAlcohol is a depressant that affects the central nervous system. It impairs\njudgment, slows down reflexes, and makes driving unsafe. Very high\nlevels of alcohol in the bloodstream can affect the brain’s ability to\ncontrol the body’s breathing, heart rate, and temperature, which can\nlead to death. Alcohol poisoning occurs when large quantities of alcohol\nare consumed in a short period of time, resulting in toxic levels of alcohol\nin the body.\nThere are many factors that can contribute to an unsafe blood alcohol\n• Speed of drinking\n• Full or empty stomach\n• Type of alcohol\n• The person’s weight and sex\nPoisons165",

They rely\non the tick detaching itself, which could take hours. As long as the\ntick’s mouthparts are in contact with the skin, the tick is potentially\ntransmitting disease. The goal is to remove the tick in one piece as quickly\nas possible. The best tool for doing this is a pair of fine-tipped tweezers\nor a special tick removal tool, such as a tick key.\nLyme Disease\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria that\nare transmitted to humans through\nbites from infected ticks. If Lyme disease\nis not treated, it can become a chronic\ncondition with serious symptoms such as\ncognitive dysfunction, joint and muscle\npain, and neurological disorders.Ticks can be infected with more than one type of bacteria\nthat can cause human illness. Signs can appear weeks to\nmonths after a bite. If a person feels unwell after a tick\nbite, he or she should seek medical attention.\nPoisons169",

In fact,\nthey are likely to cause pain and injury. Your time is better spent seeking\nmedical attention as quickly as possible.\nSpider Bites\nVery few spiders in Canada can cause serious illness or death. The bites of\nharmless spiders often cause reactions similar to those of bee stings (e.g.,\nswelling, redness, and stinging or pain at the site). However, two types\nof venomous spiders are occasionally encountered in Canada: the brown\nrecluse and the black widow. The bite of either spider can, in rare cases,\nbe life-threatening.\nBlack Widow Spiders\nThe black widow spider is black with\na reddish hourglass shape on the\nunderside of its body. Its bite is the\nmost painful and deadly of all the\nwidow spiders, especially for very\nyoung children and older adults. The\nbite usually causes an immediate, sharp,\n\"pin-prick\" pain, followed by dull pain in\nthe area of the bite. However, the person often does not know that he or\nshe has been bitten until he or she starts to feel ill or notices a bite mark\nor swelling.\nThe signs and symptoms of a black widow spider bite (e.g., abdominal\ncramps), can mimic those of other medical emergencies. Anyone with\na suspected bite should be seen by a doctor for correct diagnosis and\ntreatment.Brown Recluse Spiders\nThe brown recluse spider has a\ndistinctive violin-shaped pattern on the\nback of its front body section. At first,\nthe bite may produce little or no pain.\nPain in the area of the bite develops\nan hour or more later. A blood-filled\nblister forms under the surface of the\nskin, sometimes in a target or bull’s-\neye pattern. Over several hours, the\nblister increases in size and eventually\nruptures, leading to tissue destruction\nand a black scab.\nWhat to Look For\nSigns and symptoms of spider bites depend on the amount of venom\ninjected and the person’s sensitivity to the venom. Most spider bites heal\nwith no adverse effects or scarring. Signs and symptoms of venomous\nspider bites can seem identical to those of other conditions and therefore\ncan be difficult to recognize. The only way for a First Aider to be certain\nthat a venomous spider has bitten a person is to have witnessed it.\nBlack Widow Spider Bite\nSigns and symptoms of a black widow spider bite include the following:\n• A raised, round, red mark\n• Cramping pain in the thighs, shoulders, back, and abdominal\n• Restlessness and anxiety\n• Dizziness\n• Headache\n• Excessive sweating\n• Weakness172172\nPoisons172",

In general,\nchildren’s immune systems are less developed and less able to resist\ninfection.\nInfections can spread quickly between children, as they don’t always\nfollow proper hygiene procedures (such as blowing their noses and\nwashing their hands). Child care settings have special notification and\ndisinfection procedures, so ensure that you are aware of the protocols\nthat apply to your workplace and follow them carefully.\nProtecting Children from Infection\nIn a child care setting, protect children from infectious diseases by:\n• Insisting that staff members who are sick not come in to work.\n• Encouraging parents and guardians to keep sick children at home.\n• Having an isolation room for children who unexpectedly become ill.\n• Washing your hands before and after contact with a child who has\ndiarrhea or is vomiting.\n• Washing bedding and equipment at least once a week, or every day\nwhen children are sick.\n• Teaching children the importance of covering their mouths\n(preferably with the inside of their elbow) when they cough or\nsneeze and washing their hands afterward.\nIn a child care setting, follow these guidelines for cleaning the bathroom:\n• Clean and sanitize the bathroom sink, countertop, toilet, and floor\nwith a bleach solution once a day.\n• If you use the bathroom sink to clean toilet trainers, use a bleach\nsolution to sanitize the sink afterward.Questions to Ask Yourself If You Think a Child May Be Ill\nIt can be more difficult to identify illness in a child than in an adult,\nbecause children may not be as good at communicating what is wrong.\nIf you suspect that a child may be ill, ask yourself the questions in the\nfollowing table.

Some\nconditions cause irritation and discomfort, while others can cause\nlifelong complications or even death. Preventative practices include\nproper hygiene (including routine hand washing) and limiting exposure\nto people who are ill. Babies who are 6 months or older are the most\nvulnerable to these diseases.\nVaccination is also a fundamental preventive strategy. Vaccines have been\nincredibly effective in preventing childhood diseases and decreasing child\nmortality rates. Common childhood vaccines include diphtheria, tetanus,\npertussis, measles, mumps, and rubella.\nProvincial/territorial legislation dictates which contagious diseases must\nbe reported to the local health unit. For some contagious diseases,\nparents and guardians have a responsibility to ensure that the child care\nfacility or school is informed, in addition to the local health unit.\nChildhood Illnesses178",

The epiglottis is a flap of tissue above the vocal cords\nthat protects the airway during swallowing. When it becomes infected,\nit can swell until the airway is completely obstructed. A child with\nepiglottitis may:\n• Appear severely ill and have a high fever.\n• Need to be sitting up.\n• Strain to breathe.\n• Appear to be very frightened.\n• Drool from the mouth, as swelling may prevent swallowing.Croup is a respiratory condition, usually triggered by an acute viral\ninfection of the upper airways. The infection causes swelling of the\nthroat and of the tissues below the vocal cords. Croup is generally\nnon-life-threatening, but it can lead to severe shortness of breath and\nhypoxia. Croup is commonly identified by its distinctive harsh, barking\ncough, often described as being like the bark of a seal. Croup is often\npreceded by 1 or 2 days of illness, sometimes with a fever. Croup occurs\nmore often in the winter months and the signs and symptoms of croup\nare often more evident in the evening. The child may show improvement\nwhen exposed to cool air.\nChildhood Illnesses186",

If the child’s\ntemperature rises to 39°C (102°F) or is not easily controlled, seek medical\nattention.\nA fever alone is not a clear indicator of how sick a child is. A child may\nbe very sick and not have a fever, or may be running a fever and playing\nhappily. The best way to gauge the severity of an illness is to note\nchanges in the child’s behaviour.\nTaking a Child’s Temperature\nNormal body temperature is 37°C\n(98.6°F). Anything higher than this\nis considered a fever. To determine a\nchild’s temperature you must use a\nthermometer. Many types of digital\nthermometers are available, including\nthose intended for use in the mouth\nand ear. Follow these general principles\nwhen taking a child’s temperature,\nalong with any specific manufacturer’s\ninstructions for your thermometer.\nDo not take the temperature rectally as this can damage\nthe bowel lining.What to Do\n1. Wash your hands thoroughly.\n2. If taking the temperature orally, make sure that the child has\nnot had anything hot or cold to eat or drink in the previous 10\n3. Clean and reset the thermometer as per the manufacturer’s\nguidelines.\n4. Place the thermometer in the child’s mouth (under the tongue)\nor in the child’s ear.\n5. Leave the thermometer in place until it beeps, or for up to 1\nminute (if your model does not have an audio notification).\n6. If you are using a thermometer for more than one child (e.g., in\na child care setting), use protective covers and throw them away\nafter every use.\n7. Record the temperature, the time, and the method of taking\nthe child’s temperature (e.g., \"oral\").\n8.

When caring for children, prevention, preparation, and\nconstant supervision are critical to preventing injury.\nToy and Equipment Safety\nProducts designed for children have many features to keep them safe,\nbut these products must be selected and used properly.\nYou should always discard broken equipment and toys immediately,\nand always follow the manufacturer’s directions for safe use. When\nconsidering second-hand equipment or toys, first check the label and\ncontact Health Canada to find out if there has been a recall or safety\nalert on that specific model.\nEquipment for Babies\nSafe Use of Cribs\n• Cribs manufactured before September 1986 do not meet current\nsafety standards and should be disassembled and either thrown\naway or taken to your local recycling centre.\n• Manufacturers of cribs are required to include a label showing the\ndate of manufacture. If there is no label, assume that the crib is not\nsafe to use.\n• Allow only one small toy inside the crib and remove all mobiles or\nactivity centres as soon as the baby can pull him- or herself up.\n• Place the crib well away from potential hazards such as blind cords,\nwindows, pictures, and shelves.\n• When a child shows signs of trying to climb out of a crib, it is time to\nmove the child to a bed or mattress on the floor.\n• Keep the wheels on a crib locked whenever it is in use.\n• Make sure that the crib slats are no more than 6 cm (2 3/8 in.) apart.• Make sure that the corner posts extend no more than 3 cm (1 1/4 in.)\nabove the headboard and footboard.\n• The height from the mattress support to the top rail must be at least\n66 cm (26 in.) when the support is in its lowest position.\n• Make sure the mattress fits snugly inside the crib. Use only\nmattresses sold for use in cribs. Any other substitutes, such as foam\npads, may allow for pockets or spaces in which a child may get stuck\nor be smothered.\nSafe Use of Playpens\n• Manufacturers of playpens are required to include a Canadian\nStandards Association (CSA) label showing that the playpen has\nbeen approved by CSA. The label also shows the playpen’s date of\nmanufacture. Any playpen manufactured before 1985 has not been\napproved by the CSA. If there is no label, assume that the playpen is\nnot safe to use.\n• If a child shows signs of trying to climb out of a playpen, the playpen\nis no longer safe for that child.\n• Ensure that the playpen’s wheels are locked whenever it is in use.\n• Make sure that playpen walls are sturdy and at least 48 cm (19 in.)\n• Inspect the playpen regularly to ensure that there are no hazards\nsuch as rips or exposed sharp edges.\nSafe Use of High Chairs\n• Do not allow older children to climb on the chair, even when it is\nunoccupied.\n• A safe chair is stable and has a wide base to reduce the risk of tipping.\n• The harness should consist of a strap that fits between the child’s\nlegs and a waist belt that is easy to fasten and is in good condition.\nCaring for Children192",

The label also shows the stroller’s date of\nmanufacture. Any stroller manufactured before 1985 has not been\napproved by the CSA. If there is no label, assume that the stroller is\nnot safe to use.\n• Do not load heavy parcels on the back or on the handles of the\nbaby stroller. These could cause the stroller to tip backward.\n• Use a stroller with safety straps that go around the child’s waist and\nbetween the legs.\n• Keep children’s fingers away from moving parts.\nSafe Use of Pacifiers\n• When purchasing a pacifier, make sure it is from a reputable\nmanufacturer.\n• Check pacifiers regularly for wear and tear. Discard them\nimmediately if there is any sign of deterioration, such as\ndiscolouration, hardening, or cracking of the nipple.\n• If a doctor diagnoses a child or baby with a yeast infection of the\nmouth, immediately discard any pacifier the baby is using. Give the\nbaby a new one only after the infection has cleared.\n• Use a pacifier clip, as opposed to a cord, to secure the pacifier to\nthe child.\n• A teething ring should be used instead of a pacifier once the baby’s\nteeth start to appear.Equipment for Children\nSafe Use of Child Bike Trailers\n• Child bike trailers are recommended over child bike carriers because\nthey reduce the risk of falls, do not cause as many steering and\nbalance problems, and increase protection from the weather. They\nare also farther from the bicycle wheels, ensuring that the child\ncannot reach the spokes.\n• If possible, choose a bike trailer that has a five-point harness and\n• Attach a tall, bright flag to the trailer.\n• Connect the trailer with a flexible joint so that it will not tip over,\neven if the bike does.\n• As a bike trailer is wider than a bike, ensure that the wheels do not\ngo over the road edge.\n• Ride in low-traffic areas.\n• Ensure that children wear Canadian Standards Association (CSA)\napproved and properly fitting helmets.\nSafe Use of Safety Gates\n• Use only approved safety gates. Avoid makeshift alternatives, such\nas pieces of furniture.\n• Manufacturers of safety gates are required to include a label\nshowing the date of manufacture. If there is no label, assume that it\nis not safe to use.\n• If you can fit a pop can between the railings, a child could get stuck\nand the gate is not safe.\n• Install safety gates wherever stairs are exposed (at the top and\nbottom of the staircase).

Label the bottle and make a fresh solution every day.\n• When there are older children in the same space, their toys may\nhave smaller parts: These toys should be separated and stored out of\ncommon play areas.\n• Avoid toys with sharp edges.\n• Paints, crayons, and markers must be completely washable and non-\n• Ensure that toys (and all of their detachable pieces) are too big to fit\ninto the baby’s or child’s mouth, ears, or nose.\n• Provide only toys without strings because strings may cause\nstrangulation.\n• Inspect toys regularly. Discard any pieces that are loose. If the toy\nseems unsafe, discard it immediately.\n• Wooden toys should be glued or screwed together instead of nailed.\n• Ride-around or ride-on toys must be selected according to the size\nof the child.\n• Children should wear all safety equipment that is recommended\nfor the activity. “Toy” protective gear (e.g., plastic helmets) is for\nimaginative play only.• Electrical toys must bear the Canadian Standards Association (CSA)\n• Choose costumes that are made of flame-retardant materials. Use\nface paints instead of face masks to avoid blocking vision.\n• Large toy boxes and other containers must have air holes and self-\nsupporting hinges if they have lids. This is necessary in case children\ndecide to hide inside.\nPlayground Safety\nPlaygrounds are the site of many serious injuries, mainly falls. Some\nplayground equipment can be unsafe or inappropriate for certain age\ngroups. The following points help to keep children safe on the playground:\n• Examine park and school playgrounds for hazards such as broken\nglass or exposed sharp edges.\n• Ensure that children use playground equipment as intended (e.g.,\nensure that they do not climb on the outside of a tubular slide).\n• Ensure that there are enough adults present to watch all children\ncarefully.\n• If you see unsafe or broken equipment in a playground, report this\nto the managing agency (e.g., community centre, park board, school\n• If you are installing or maintaining playground equipment, consider\nthe age and size of the children who will be using it, and follow the\nmanufacturer’s directions.\n• Ideally, sandboxes should be fitted with a cover to keep dogs, cats,\nand other animals from using it as a litter box.\nProvincial/territorial legislation specifies regulations\nfor child care centre play equipment.\nCaring for Children194",

Wearing helmets can reduce the risk\nof a serious or fatal head injury by up to 80%.\nKeep the following points in mind when choosing a helmet for a child:\n• Use helmets approved by the Canadian Standards Association\n(CSA), Snell Memorial Foundation, or American National Standards\nInstitute (ANSI).\n• A helmet should fit squarely on the child’s head and have a snug\nchin strap.\nIf a helmet is involved in a fall, buy another one. Even if no damage is\nvisible, the helmet may have lost some of its ability to absorb shock.\nAs a role model and for safety reasons, adults should\nalways wear a helmet while riding a bicycle.\nSafe Use of Bicycles\nEnsure that children follow these rules when using a bicycle:\n• Walk bicycles across roads only at intersections and pedestrian\ncrosswalks.\n• Before you cross, make sure that traffic crossing your path is fully\nstopped at stop signs or traffic signals.\n• Ride in a straight line when you go down a road or street. Do not\nswerve between parked cars or onto driveways. Always look and\nsignal in plenty of time before turning.\n• Wear bright clothes even during the day. When motorists can see a\ncyclist, it is easier for them to co-operate with the cyclist.\n• Do not ride a bicycle after dark.Local legislation may dictate what needs to be on\nyour bike for safety (e.g., bike lights).1. Have the child stand over the bicycle seat with both feet flat on\nthe ground.\n2. Lift the bicycle up to the child’s body (both tires off the floor).\nThere should be at least 2.5 cm (1 in.) between the tires and the\nfloor. Adjust the height of the seat as needed.\nWhile on the seat, the child should be able to put the balls of his or her\nfeet on the ground.\nRegularly check the following for any bicycle used by a child:\n• The brakes must work properly, and the child must be able to use\nthem safely.\n• The tires must be fully inflated.\n• The wheels must be tightly secured and truly round.\n• The chain must be oiled and tight.\n• The spokes must be tight, straight, and unbroken.\n• The seat post and handlebars must be securely attached.\n• The bike must have a working bell or horn.\n• The bicycle must pass the \"bounce test:\" Bounce the bicycle up and\ndown on its wheels on a paved surface and listen for shakes and\nrattles. A safe bike is a quiet bike.\nCaring for Children196",

This will reduce the risk of igniting\npot holders, aprons, and other kitchen items.\n• Snuff out candles immediately after use.\n• Keep all hot drinks out of children’s reach.\n• For nightwear, use only clothing designated as sleepwear. Other\nmaterials are sometimes more flammable. The government sets\nguidelines as to what is classified as sleepwear.\n• Contact your local fire department for information on inspecting\nyour home or workplace (including child care settings) for fire\nhazards and reviewing your fire escape plan.\n• Make sure that smoke detectors are placed in all areas required by\nyour local fire department or whichever agency regulates fire safety\nin your area. Change the batteries in all smoke detectors twice a year.\n• Keep bedroom and sleeping-area doors closed when children are\nsleeping. Doors are important barriers to smoke.\n• Make sure that all breakers and fuses on the electrical panel in your\nhome, workplace, or child care setting are clearly labelled.\n• Use only single-cord plugs, as multiple-cord or octopus plugs may\noverheat. Keep loose cords secured and out of the way to prevent\ntripping and to keep children from pulling them out.\n• Keep an approved, all-purpose chemical fire extinguisher in the\nkitchen.Even the safest cyclist must watch for drivers who aren’t\npaying attention!\nIt is important to teach children balancing, turning, hand\nsignalling, and stopping on a bicycle before they go out\nriding.

    "content": "Generally speaking, you should avoid moving an injured or ill person to\ngive care. Unnecessary movement can cause additional injury and pain\nand may complicate the person’s recovery.\nThree general situations require you to move a person:\n1. There is an immediate danger (either a danger to you or to\nthe person being rescued) e.g., from fire, a lack of oxygen, risk\nof drowning, a possible explosion, a collapsing structure, or\nuncontrolled traffic hazards.\n2. You have difficulty accessing ill or injured people. For example, a\nperson with minor injuries may need to be moved quickly to allow\naccess to other people who may have life-threatening conditions.\n3. There is a barrier that makes it difficult to provide proper care. For\nexample, a person with a medical emergency, such as a cardiac\narrest or heat stroke, may need to be moved to provide proper care.\nFor example, a person in cardiac arrest requires CPR, which should\nbe performed on a firm, flat surface. If the person collapses on a bed\nor in a small bathroom, the surface or space may not be adequate to\nprovide appropriate care, and the person will need to be moved.\nUsually, you will not face hazards that require you to move the person\nimmediately. In most cases, you can give the necessary care wherever\nyou find the person. Needless movement of a person can lead to further\ninjury, and therefore should be avoided. For example, moving someone\nwith a closed fracture of the leg, without taking the time to splint it,\ncould result in an open fracture if the end of the bone tears the skin.\nThis may result in soft-tissue damage, damage to nerves, blood loss, and\ninfection.Some rescue situations make gaining access to people especially\nchallenging, and as such require first responders who have specialized\ntraining and equipment. One such situation is when the ill or injured\nperson is in a confined space. Confined spaces are particularly challenging\nbecause they:\n• Are not designed or intended to have people in them\n• Have restricted entrances or exits due to their location, size, or\n• Can present a risk to the health and safety of anyone who enters\n(including first responders), due to one or more of the following\n¶Their design, construction, location, or atmosphere\n¶The materials or substances inside\n¶Work activities being carried out inside\nBefore you act, you must consider the limitations of the situation.\nConsidering the following factors will help you ensure that you move a\nperson quickly and safely:\n• Dangerous conditions at the scene\n• The size of the person\n• Your own physical ability\n• Whether others can assist you\n• The person’s condition\nFailing to consider these factors could result in an injury to the First\nAider—you. If you become injured, you may be unable to move the\nperson and may risk making the situation worse. Back injuries (and other\nmusculoskeletal injuries) can occur as a result of lifting and carrying a\ngreat deal of equipment during an emergency. If this happens at a scene,\nyou will not be able to help and another First Aider will have to provide\ncare for you, in addition to the other ill or injured person/people.\nAppendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person204",

    "content": "To protect yourself and the ill or injured person, follow these guidelines\nwhen moving someone:\n• Attempt to move a person only when you are sure you can\ncomfortably handle the rescue.\n• Walk carefully, using short steps.\n• Walk forward with the person, instead of backward, wherever\n• Always take the shortest, most direct route to your destination, as\nlong as it is safe.\n• Scan the pathway you want to use before moving so that you can\nidentify potential hazards (such as slip hazards or poor lighting). them as a unit. This will reduce twisting forces.\n• Reduce the height or distance you need to move a weight and lift in\nstages, if necessary.\n• Keep your wrists and knees in normal alignment.\nIf performed incorrectly, reaching for a person or object can also injure\nthe ligaments of your back. When reaching, keep your back locked (avoid\nhyperextending it) and never twist your back. You should avoid reaching\nmore than 15 to 20 centimetres (6 to 8 in.) in front of the body as the\nmuscles in your upper back and shoulders can only stay stretched in that\nposition for a matter of seconds before they become fatigued and the\nrisk of injury increases.\nHow to Move an Ill or Injured Person\nThere are many different ways to move someone to safety. The move is\nsuccessful as long as you can move the person without injuring yourself,\ncausing further injury to the person, or taking unnecessary risks.\nAssists, carries, and drags are the different ways you can safely move an\ninjured person. The most common of these moves include the following:\n• Walking assist\n• Two-person seat carry\n• Clothes drag\n• Blanket drag\n• Extremity lift\nThese moves can be performed by one or two people without\nspecialized equipment. This is important because equipment is often not\nimmediately available and time is usually critical when a person must be\nmoved. There are specific ways to deal with confined spaces (e.g., a\ngrain silo, vat, or pipe). Without appropriate training, you\nare putting yourself at risk if you enter them. Ensure that\nthe appropriate responders are on the way and manage the\nscene until they arrive. Only people with specialized training\nand equipment should enter confined spaces.\nBody Mechanics\nTo reduce the risk of personal injury, everyone involved in a lift or carry\nshould use proper body mechanics (also called “biomechanics”). The basic\nprinciples of body mechanics that can be used for all lifts and moves\ninclude the following:\n• Use your legs, not your back, to lift. When lifting, use the muscles\nof your legs, hips, buttocks, and abdomen. Never use the muscles of\nyour back to move or lift a heavy load.\n• Keep the weight as close to you as possible. Reduce the distance you\nhave to reach.\n• Keep your body aligned. Imagine a straight line running from your\nshoulders through your hips and down to your feet, and then move 205205\nAppendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person205",

It is constructed of either plywood or plastic. Backboards are\neither rectangular in shape or tapered at one end. The board has holes\ncut along the sides through which straps may be placed to secure the\nperson’s body to the board. Most boards are approximately 1.8 metres (6\nfeet) long. If a backboard is used with a basket stretcher, the board must\nfit inside the stretcher. Basket Stretcher\nThe basket stretcher, also called the Stokes basket, comes in various\ntypes and strengths. Traditional basket stretchers are constructed of\nmetal support frames, usually combined with a wire mesh lining. Other\nbasket stretchers have metal frames and high-impact plastic liners. Basket\nstretchers are commonly used for rescues and also as lifting devices.\nFollow these guidelines when using a basket stretcher:\n• Place blankets under the person for comfort.\n• Place a backboard or litter board on the bottom to make loading\nand unloading easier.\n• If used in combination with a scoop stretcher, the basket stretcher\nmust be able to accommodate the scoop stretcher.\n• Secure the person if the stretcher is to be carried over a long\ndistance or the person is to be lowered or raised off the ground as in\na low- or high-angle rescue.\nAppendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person209",

It has an adjustable head\nsection and leg section. Each side of\nthe stretcher has a safety rail. The\nstretcher should not be lifted using\nthese rails. This stretcher is commonly\nused in transportation vehicles, such as\nambulances.\nFlexible Litter\nA flexible litter has no rigid structure\nof its own. These devices are made\nof synthetic materials that require\nsome type of spinal immobilization\ndevice to provide rigidity. Because\nthey are flexible, they work well when\nmoving peoples through narrow\npassageways. They wrap around the\nperson, so the litter is little more than\nthe circumference of the person’s body.\nFlexible litters also have the distinct\nadvantage of being usable with people\nof a variety of sizes, including those\nfor whom a basket stretcher may be\nrestrictive.\nStair Chair\nA stair chair is used for transporting a\nperson in a sitting position. It is used\nwhen a wheeled stretcher is deemed to\nbe too long for the rescue or extrication.\nIt is especially useful when there is a\nsmall elevator or staircase in which a\nlong stretcher will not fit. The front\nwheels swivel to manoeuvre around\ntight corners and landings. Some stair\nchairs have a track that make navigating\nstairs or steep terrains easier for the First\nAiders. When using the stair chair, it is\nrecommended that three First Aiders\nbe present to ensure a person’s safety:\ntwo First Aiders to act as carriers and\none to serve as a spotter for potential\ndifficulties.\nAppendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person210",

    "content": "As a First Aider, you need a basic understanding of normal human\nstructure and function. Knowing the body’s structures and how they\nwork will help you more easily recognize and understand illnesses and\ninjuries. Body systems do not function independently. Each system\ndepends on other systems to function properly. When your body is\nhealthy, your body systems are working well together. But an injury or\nillness in one body part or system will often cause problems in others.\nKnowing the location and function of the major organs and structures\nwithin each body system will help you to more accurately assess a\npatient’s condition and provide the best care.\nBody Systems\nThe human body performs many complex functions. Vital organs are\norgans whose functions are essential for life, such as the brain, heart, and\nA body system is a group of organs and other structures that are\nespecially adapted to perform specific body functions. They work\ntogether to carry out a function needed for life. For example, the heart,\nblood, and blood vessels make up the circulatory system, which keeps all\nparts of the body supplied with oxygen-rich blood.\nFor the body to work properly, all of the body’s systems must work well\ntogether. When one or more of the body systems does not perform its\nfunction properly, illness can occur.Interrelationships of Body Systems\nEach body system plays a vital role in survival. Body systems work\ntogether to help the body maintain a constant healthy state. When the\nenvironment changes, the body’s systems adapt to the new conditions.\nFor example, because the musculoskeletal system works harder during\nexercise, the respiratory and circulatory systems must also work harder to\nmeet the body’s increased oxygen demands. Your body systems also react\nto the stresses caused by illness or injury.\nThe impact of an injury or a disease is rarely restricted to one body\nsystem. For example, a broken bone may result in nerve damage\nthat may impair movement and feeling. Injuries to the ribs can make\nbreathing difficult. If the heart stops beating for any reason, breathing\nwill also stop.\nIn any significant illness or injury, body systems may be seriously\naffected. This may result in a progressive failure of multiple body systems.\nGenerally, the more body systems that are involved in an emergency, the\nmore serious the emergency.\nAppendix B: Moving an Ill or Injured Person211",

To maintain a\nclean, hazard-free workplace, all groups – management,\nsupervision, and workers – must cooperate.\nRegulations for safehousekeeping require\n– daily jobsite cleanup\n– disposal of rubbish\n– individual cleanup\nduties for all workers\n– materials piled,\nstacked, orotherwise stored toprevent tipping andcollapsing\n– materials stored away from overhead powerlines– work and travel areas\nkept tidy, well-lit, and ventilated (Figure 8)\n– signs posted to warn workers of hazardous areas.\nThe basics of good housekeeping are shown in Figure 9.\n• Gather up and remove debris as often as required to\nkeep work and travel areas orderly.\n• Keep equipment and the areas around equipment\nclear of scrap and waste.\n• Keep stairways, passageways, and gangways free of\nmaterial, supplies, and obstructions at all times.\n• Secure loose or light materials stored on roof or on\nopen floors to prevent them being blown by the wind.\n• Pick up, store, or dispose of tools, material, or debris\nwhich may cause tripping or other hazards.\n• Before handling used lumber, remove or bend over\nprotruding nails and chip away hardened concrete.\n• Wear eye protection when there is any risk of eye injury.\n• Do not permit rubbish to fall freely from any level of the\nproject. Lower it by means of a chute or other approved\ndevices (Figure 10).\n• Do not throw materials or tools from one level to\n• Do not lower or raise any tool or equipment by its own\ncord or supply hose.• When guardrails must be\nremoved to land, unload, or\nhandle material, wear fall-arrest equipment (Figure11). The area must also beroped off with warning signsposted.\nIn shops it is relatively easy tomaintain a clean work area. Barriers\nand warning lines can also be set up toisolate table saws and other equipment.\nOn construction sites, arrangements aremore difficult. Equipment often sits inbasements, on decks, or in cornerswith insufficient working space andsometimes it’s open to the weather.The footing may simply consist ofa piece of plywood.\nAround table saws and\nsimilar equipment, keep theimmediate area clear ofscrap to avoid tripping\nhazards and providesound footing.\nAirborne wood dust can be a respiratory hazard, causing\nproblems ranging from simple irritation of the eyes, nose,and throat to more serious health effects. Dust collectorsshould be installed in shops to remove sawdust from air\nand equipment. Wood dust is also very flammable.\nIn construction, saws and other tools are often operated in\nthe open air where dust presents no hazard. However,dust masks or respirators should be worn wheneverventilation is inadequate.\nKeep stairs and landings cl ear and well-lit.\nGood housekeeping means cl ear t raffic and work areas, ou t-of-the-way\nstorage, ade quate illuminat ion, and c leanup o f debris.\nSignsFigure 10\nSecur e material against th e wind.\nAfter removing material, resecur e pile.Fall\nArrestTravel",

    "content": "31 – 2TRENCHING\nSoil types\nThe type of soil determines the strength and\nstability of trench walls.\nIdentifying soil types requires knowledge, skill,\nand experience. Even hard soil may containfaults in seams or layers that make it unstablewhen excavated.\nThe foreman or supervisor must be\nknowledgeable about soil types found on aproject and plan protection accordingly. Thisknowledge must include an awareness that soiltypes and conditions can change over very shortdistances. It is not unusual for soil to changecompletely within 50 metres or for soil tobecome saturated with moisture over evensmaller distances.\nThe Construction Regulation sets out four soil\ntypes. If you are unsure about the soil type,have the soil tested to confirm the type.\nType 1 — It is hard to drive a pick into Type 1\nsoil. Hence, it is often described as “hardground to dig”. In fact, the material is so hard, itis close to rock.\nWhen excavated, the sides of the excavation\nappear smooth and shiny. The sides will remainvertical with no water released from the trenchwall.\nIf exposed to sunlight for several days, the walls\nof Type 1 soil will lose their shiny appearancebut remain intact without cracking andcrumbling.\nIf exposed to rain or wet weather, Type 1 soil\nmay break down along the edges of theexcavation.\nTypical Type 1 soils include “hardpan,”\nconsolidated clay, and some glacial tills.\nType 2 — A pick can be driven into Type 2\nsoil relatively easily. It can easily be excavatedby a backhoe or hand-excavated with somedifficulty.In Type 2 soil, the sides of a trench will remainvertical for a short period of time (perhapsseveral hours) with no apparent tension cracks.However, if the walls are left exposed to air andsunlight, tension cracks will appear as the soilstarts to dry. The soil will begin cracking andsplaying into the trench.\nTypical Type 2 soils are silty clay and less dense\nType 3 — Much of the Type 3 soil encountered\nin construction is previously excavated material.\nType 3 soil can be excavated without difficultyusing a hydraulic backhoe.\nWhen dry, Type 3 soil will flow through fingers\nand form a conical pile on the ground. DryType 3 soil will not stand vertically and thesides of the excavation will cave in to a naturalslope of about 1 to 1 depending on moisture.\nWet Type 3 soil will yield water when vibrated\nby hand. When wet, this soil will stand verticallyfor a short period.

These can all contribute to thecollapse of trench walls.\nA surcharge is an excessive load or weight thatcan affect trench stability.\nFor instance, excavated soil piled next to the\ntrench can exert pressure on the walls.Placement of spoil piles is therefore important.Spoil should be kept as far as is practical fromthe edge of the trench. Mobile equipment andother material stored close to the trench alsoadd a surcharge that will affect trench stability.\nOne metre from the edge to the toe of the spoil\npile is the minimum distance requirement(Figure 4). The distance should be greater fordeeper trenches.\nPrevious excavation\nOld utility trenches either crossing or runningparallel to the new trench can affect the strengthand stability (Figure 5).\nSoil around and between these old excavations\ncan be very unstable. At best it is consideredType 3 soil — loose, soft, and low in internalstrength. In some unusual circumstances it maybe Type 4 — wet, muddy, and unable tosupport itself.\nThis kind of soil will not stand up unless it is\nsloped or shored.\nExisting foundations\nAround most trenches and excavations there is afailure zone where surcharges, changes in soilcondition, or other disruptions can causecollapse.\nWhen the foundation of a building adjacent to\nthe trench or excavation extends into this failurezone, the result can be a cave-in (Figure 6). Soilin this situation is usually considered Type 3.\nRain, melting snow, thawing earth, and overflowfrom adjacent streams, storm drains, and sewersall produce changes in soil conditions. In fact,water from any source can reduce soil cohesion(Figure 7).\nExisting foundations are surrounded by\nbackfill and may add a surcharge load to the pressure on the trench wall.\nMove spoil pile farther back for deep trenches\nOld utilities are surrounded by backfilled soil which is usually\nless stable than undisturbed soil.",

In its stored state it is aliquid but is released from thecylinder or tank in a gaseous form.The boiling point of propane, thepoint at which the liquid converts toa gas, is -42.2°C (-44°F). If thesurrounding air temperature is abovethis, gas will form in the upper partof the cylinder (Figure 1).\nThe pressure within the container is\nvariable depending on the\ntemperature to which the container isexposed (Table 1). The pressureincreases as the temperature rises,causing expansion of the liquid. For this reason containersare never fully charged with liquid, but have a vapourspace at the top of the tank to allow for normal expansion.\nShould the temperature rise above safe limits, a relief\nvalve will open to allow release of the gas in a measuredamount. This release is generally over in seconds. Thevalve reseals and remains closed until the pressure buildsup again. Cylinder relief valves are set at 2585.5 kPa (375lb per square inch).\nPropane is packaged in a number of cylinder types and\nsizes to meet a variety of applications:\n• 100-lb cylinders for construction heaters, roofing\nkettles, and other appliances that consume large\namounts of fuel. They are called 100 lb cylindersbecause they are charged with 100 lb of liquid at thepropane plant.\n• 20-lb cylinders for oxypropane welding set-ups. (This\nis a familiar size that will be used on such appliancesas household gas barbecues.)\n• 10 and 20 lb cylinders for soldering work.• 14 oz. throwaway containers for various hand-held\ntorch applications.\nPropane can be easily compressed from a gaseous to aliquid state in small cylinders, making it very portable.When the liquid converts back to a gas, it expands 270times in volume. Compared to natural gas, propane has aheating value that is 2.5 times greater. One cubic foot ofpropane converts to 2500 BTUs, while one cubic foot ofnatural gas converts to only 1000 BTUs. This explains whyso much energy (BTUs) can be contained in a smallcylinder, making it a very convenient fuel for the contractor.\nBut the high-energy value of propane also makes it very\ndangerous to handle. It only takes a tiny leak to form anexplosive gas/air mixture.\nThe high flammability of propane can be seen by comparing\nits ignition characteristics with those of gasoline (Table 2).\nWhen you consider that the heat from a lighted cigarette\nranges between 1000°F and 1600°F , and that a lightedmatch produces 2000°F , all that is necessary forcombustion is a sufficient quantity of propane gas mixedwith air. This is why safety procedures must be followed sothat a very efficient energy source does not become ahazard to workers.PROPANE\nCutaway view\nof vapour withdrawal\npropane cylinder\nTemperature/Pressure Variables (values taken from CSA Standard B149.2-M80)\nTable 1*kilopascals *pounds per square inch\nPropane Gasoline\nMinimum ignition 493° - 549°C 427° - 482°C\ntemperature range (920° - 1020°F) (800°- 900°F)\nFlammability limits in air 2.4 - 9.5% 1.3 - 7.5%\nVapour density (air=1) 1.52 3.50\nMinimum flash point -104°C (-156°F) -51°C (-60°F)",

The purpose of this valve is to shut off gas flowshould the regulator accidentally be broken off.\n• To unslug the check valve, shut off the flow at the\ncylinder, wait a couple of minutes for the check valve toreopen, then proceed. The cylinder valve should beopened slowly to its normal limit, approximately 1-1/2 to 2 turns. Do not force the valve beyond this limit.\n• Secure the cylinder by tying or wiring it to a column or\nother upright. Keep cylinders out of traffic areas wherethey may be knocked over.\n• Cylinder and heater must always be in the same room\nso that the cylinder valve can be shut down quickly iftrouble develops.\n• Keep heaters away from flammable materials. The\nheat from a burner is effective well past the tip.\n• Watch for a drop in pressure or\nreduced flame efficiency. Thisindicates that gas is beingwithdrawn too quickly, and mayrequire additional cylinders tobe hooked up in manifold.Never attempt to increase the\namount of vapour by applyingheat to the cylinder.\n• Where possible, use only single cylinders for heaters.\nHowever, if cylinders must be manifolded, use no\nmore than three 100-pound cylinders (Figure 7). Ifother heaters with manifolded cylinders are to beoperated in the same area, they must be at least fiftyfeet away or be separated by a firewall.\n• Remember that propane is heavier than air and will\ncollect in low areas such as trenches, pits, andbasements where it can create a flammable orexplosive situation (Figure 8).\n• Never attempt to tie down, defeat, or bypass safety\ndevices on a construction heater. If the heater isdefective, replace it. If the heater is inadequate, getextra heaters or replace it with a larger one.\n• If the flame goes out, act with caution. Shut off the gas\nsupply, then determine whether escaped gas isconcentrated in the area. Because of its strong odour,you can usually smell propane. However, in a confinedspace, test with a gas detection device. If escaped gasis detected or even suspected, ventilate and purge thearea thoroughly before relighting the unit.\nWarning - If the heater is in a confined or low-lyingarea, escaped gas can be hazardous. Never enter thearea without help standing by. Never attempt to relightuntil the gas is completely purged from the area.\n• Never expose any part of your skin to liquid propane.\nPropane under pressure is extremely cold and cancause frostbite. Always wear gloves when handlingcylinders.\n• Don't allow propane gas to saturate your clothing. A\nhighly flammable situation can remain for some timeafter the exposure. Saturated clothing should beremoved and aired outside.\n• Never operate heaters without adequate ventilation.\nFollow manufacturer's recommendations on the plate.\nBulk Tanks\nPropane construction heaters that operate from a centralbulk storage tank are common on large constructionprojects. This type of installation takes planning and closeconsultation between contractor and gas supplier toselect a safe, convenient tank storage area that will notinterfere with on-site traffic and materials handling, norinfringe on property line clearance requirements. The bulk\ntank and feed lines are installed by\nlicensed service personnel, but\nhooking up the heaters is generally left\nto workers on the site. The feed lines\nare usually well provided with hook-up\npoints called station valves. They\nconsist of a shut-off and a connection\npoint for a flexible hose. However, the\nsame rules for hooking up to a\nportable container apply here.\n• Check for leaks at the hook-up point\nafter installing flexible heater line.\n• Make sure the shut-off valve is in\nthe same room as the heater.\n• If heat is required in an area that is\nnot serviced by a valve a qualified\nservice person should extend the\nline, or take off a spur line using\napproved piping and install a valveat its terminus.\n• Flexible hose lengths should never\nexceed 25 feet between heater andstation valve.PROPANE\nTypical Manifold Set-Up\nHeavier than air,\npropane gas can\ncollect in low areas\nand create the\npotential for\nasphyxiation or\nexplosion.Figure 8",

Here is more information on each ofthe criteria.\nPartially or fully enclosed\nBecause air cannot move freely in and out of a partially or\nfully enclosed space, there is a potential for a hazardousatmosphere to be generated inside. This is especially true forspaces such as vaults, tanks, pits, trenches, or manholes.\nNot designed and constructed for continuous human\nConfined spaces are not designed or constructed for\npeople to work in them on an ongoing basis. They areusually designed and constructed to store material,transport products, or enclose a process. But occasionally,some work must be done inside the space.\nAtmospheric hazards\nA hazardous atmosphere is one which contains any of the\nfollowing:\n➤an accumulation of flammable, combustible, or\nexplosive agents\n➤less than 19.5% or more than 23% oxygen, or\n➤an accumulation of atmospheric contaminants thatcould result in\nacute (short-term) health effects which\na) pose an immediate threat to life, or\nb) interfere with a person's ability to escape unaided\nfrom a confined space.CONFINED SPACES\nCoordination\nWhen workers of more than one employer perform\nwork in the same confined space the constructormust prepare a coordination document to ensurethat the various employers perform their duties in away that protects the health and safety of allworkers.

But if there are two or more similar confinedspaces containing the same hazards then you need onlya single assessment document.\nTo perform a hazard assessment, you need to anticipate\npotential hazards. Often, the hazards of working inconfined spaces are not recognized until it's too late.\nFor example:\n➤A mixing tank was inadvertently started while a\nworker was inside.\n➤A worker was killed by carbon monoxide gas from a\ngasoline-powered pump used to drain a pit.\nBecause construction projects are not limited to new\nbuildings, confined spaces may be encountered in a\nvariety of places. The following table describes typicalconfined spaces and the most common hazards foundthere.\nHazards in confined spaces can be divided into two\ndistinct categories: physical hazards and atmospherichazards.CONFINED SPACES\nIf control measures (such as continuous mechanical ventilation) are used to ensure that the concentrations of anatmospheric hazard are controlled or maintained at an appropriate level (but not eliminated) then the space would\nstill be considered a confined space. If, however, measures are implemented to eliminate the possibility that any\natmospheric hazards may occur in a space, then the confined space provisions no longer need to apply.Eliminating the possibility that an atmospheric hazard will occur is different from controlling the hazard. If workersmust enter the confined space to eliminate the hazards (by steam-cleaning or vacuuming, for example), then theconfined spaces provisions apply.\nEVERY CONFINED SPACE MUST BE THOROUGHLY ASSESSED AND EVALUATED BY A COMPETENT\nWORKER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE THE ATMOSPHERIC HAZARDCOMPLETELY.\nEven if a space is not defined as a confined space under the regulations, the employer must take every precaution\nreasonable in the circumstances to protect workers entering the space. COMPETENT WORKER\nin relation to specific work, means a worker who\na)is qualified because of knowledge, training and\nexperience to perform the work\nb)is familiar with the Occupational Health and\nSafety Act and the provisions of the regulations\nthat apply to the work, and\nc)has knowledge of all potential or actual dangerto health and safety in the work.",

In potentially explosiveatmospheres, use lighting designed for such situations.\nATMOSPHERIC HAZARDS\nConfined spaces can present three kinds of atmospherichazards:\n➤flammable, combustible, or explosive atmosphere\n➤oxygen-enriched or oxygen-deficient atmosphere\n➤atmospheric contaminants.\nThe hazardous atmosphere may be due to existingconditions (e.g., residue in a tank,) or it may be created bythe work being done inside the confined space (e.g.,welding or using solvents). In some cases, removingsludge or scale can release trapped pockets of gas orvapour and create a hazardous atmosphere. Moreover,dangerous atmospheres often exist together. For instance,flammable, combustible or explosive atmospheres mayalso be toxic or cause an oxygen deficiency.\nFLAMMABLE, COMBUSTIBLE, OREXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERES\nFlammable atmospheres are generally caused by\n➤evaporation of flammable liquids (e.g., gasoline)\n➤by-products of chemical reactions (e.g.,\ndecomposition of organic matter to form methane).\nExplosive atmospheres are those in which a flammable\ngas or vapour is present in quantities between the Lower\nExplosive Limit (LEL) and the Upper Explosive Limit(UEL). These limits define the “Explosive Range” whichvaries from one substance to another. Refer to the section“Fire and Explosion Hazard” of a material’s MSDS for fire-and explosion-related information.\nThe LEL is the lowest, and the UEL the highest\nconcentration of gas or vapour that will supportcombustion. For example, gasoline has an LEL of 1.4%and a UEL of 7.6%. Below 1.4% there is not enough fuelto burn, while above 7.6% there is too much fuel and notenough oxygen to burn. (See figure above.)\nThe most common explosive gas likely to be encountered\nin sewers and other underground structures is methane-or“natural gas”-produced by decaying garbage and sewage.\nOther explosive gases and vapours may be present in\nconfined spaces depending on previous contents oraccidental spills and leaks (e.g., leaking fuel-storage tanksnear service stations).\nExplosive ranges for common gases and vapours are\nlisted in Table 1. These values must be considered whenselecting and operating gas-testing equipment.\nCombustible atmospheres can arise in grain elevators,\nfeed mills, and some industrial settings such as bag\nhouses, because of the large quantities of dust generated.The most common combustible dust is grain or flour dust-there have been several explosions in grain elevators.

The primary concern with oxygen-enrichedatmospheres is the increased flammability of materials.Things that would only smoulder in normal air will burnvigorously in oxygen-enriched atmospheres.\nOxygen-enriched atmospheres are fairly rare in\nconstruction. They are usually associated with pureoxygen escaping from leaking or ruptured oxyacetylenehoses or, on projects in industrial plants, from an oxygenline in an industrial or manufacturing process.\nOxygen-deficient atmospheres, on the other hand, are\nfairly common. They may result from work being done(such as welding), bacterial action (which consumesoxygen), or from chemical reactions (such as rusting).Oxygen may also be displaced by another gas or vapour(e.g., carbon dioxide or nitrogen used to purge tanks,pipe, and vessels). Table 2 lists the effects of oxygendeficiency.ATMOSPHERIC CONTAMINANTS\nBecause confined spaces are poorly ventilated,atmospheric contaminants can build up to hazardouslevels very quickly. For construction in an industrial setting,the type of airborne hazard that may be encountereddepends on\n❑products stored in the confined space\n❑the type of work tasks performed in the confined\n❑work or processes being performed near the confinedspace.\nThe most common atmospheric contaminants in\nconstruction include hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide,sulphur dioxide, chlorine, and ammonia.\nHydrogen Sulphide (H\n2S) is a gas generated by the\ndecomposition of garbage and sewage. H2S can be found\nin sewers, sewage treatment plants, refineries, and pulp\nmills. It is also found in many oil refineries since mostcrude oil in Canada has some H\n2S dissolved in it. H2S is\nvery toxic. A single breath at a concentration of about500-700 ppm (parts per million) can be instantly fatal. Atvery low concentrations, H\n2S has the characteristic odour\nof rotten eggs. However, at about 100 ppm it can deadenyour sense of smell and create the false impression thatno hazard exists.\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) is a very common toxic gas. It\nhas no odour or taste and is clear and colourless. Carbon\nmonoxide poisoning can be very subtle and may causedrowsiness and collapse followed by death. The majorsources of CO in construction include the internalcombustion engines powering saws, scissor lifts, powertrowellers, generators, and forklift trucks. Even theserelatively small engines produce high levels of CO.

Workers should be aware of this hazard. At the first signof discomfort or disorientation they should leave the areauntil it has been ventilated.\nWorkers feeling light-headed or experiencing headaches\nmay be inhaling these pollutants. Drowsiness ordisorientation can lead to falls. Again, leave the area untilit has been ventilated.\nUnderground mines, tunnels, and shafts\nThese spaces are intended for people to carry out work in\nthem-this work is covered by specific regulation. They maypresent physical or atmospheric hazards. Many utilitiesare routed through tunnels or underground shafts wherehazardous atmospheres may collect from containers oroperations above, or be created by utility leaks (such asgas and oil).\nWork in shafts must be carefully planned. Because the\nwork may be of short duration and require only atemporary platform, these jobs are often not given properattention.\nIn addition to the areas already described, beware of\napparently harmless areas such as basements, halls, andsmall rooms that can become dangerous when a lack ofventilationandhazardousmaterials oroperationscombine tocreateatmospherichazards.CONFINED SPACES\nCase study\nA construction crew finished installing a 12-foot-deep\nmanhole without incident. After the crew left thearea, 265 pounds of nitroglycerin-based explosive in20 boreholes, each 18 feet deep, were detonated40-60 feet from the manhole. A worker who enteredthe manhole 45 minutes after the explosioncollapsed within minutes, and two coworkersdescended into the manhole to rescue him. Onerescuer retrieved the unconscious worker beforecollapsing on the surface, and the other rescuer diedin the manhole.\nAn investigation determined that carbon monoxide\nreleased from the explosion had migrated throughthe soil into the manhole. Carbon monoxideconcentrations at the bottom of the manhole two\ndays after the incident were 1,905 ppm (parts per\nmillion). This concentration was well above 1,200ppm, the concentration classified as ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH). Tests followingventilation of the manhole showed that high levels ofcarbon monoxide reappeared as a result of\ncontinued migration from the surrounding soil.\nSubsequent monitoring of the manhole showed adecline in carbon monoxide levels over the next 8days.\nIf a worker can be injured by inhaling a hazardous\ngas, vapour, dust, or fume or there is an explosionhazard then you must provide adequate ventilationby natural or mechanical means. If this is notpossible then you must provide respiratoryprotection equipment suitable for the hazard.",

    "content": "33 – 8PLAN FOR CONTROLLING\nOnce the hazards have been identified in the assessment,a competent person must develop a plan to eliminate or\ncontrol the hazards.\nThe primary objective of the plan is to eliminate the\nhazard before entry. If this is not possible, then controls,\nmeasures, and procedures must be put in place to ensurethat workers are not in danger.\nIf confined spaces are of similar construction and present\nthe same hazards, a single plan can be used. Still, theindividual confined spaces must be identified in both thehazard assessment and the plan.\nThe Plan is the program element with the most regulatory\nrequirements attached to it. The regulation outlines 11mandatory requirements that must be contained in theplan:\n1)Duties of workers\n2)Coordination document (prepared by the constructor)\nif workers of more than one contractor enter the same\nconfined space\n3)On-site rescue procedures\n4)Rescue equipment (inspected by a competent worker)\nand methods of communication\n5)Protective clothing and protective equipment\n6)Isolation of energy and control of material movement\n7)Attendants\n8)Adequate means of access and egress (entry and\n9)Atmospheric testing (conducted by a competent\n10)Adequate procedures for working in the presence ofexplosive or flammable substances\n11)Ventilation and purging.We address each of these 11 mandatory requirements\n1) DUTIES OF WORKERS\na)Do not enter or re-enter (if the confined space has\nbeen left unoccupied and unattended) the confined\nspace unless testing has been performed.\nb)Know the hazards that may be faced upon entry.\nKnow the route of exposure (e.g., inhalation or skinabsorption), signs and symptoms, and long-termeffects of exposure.\nc)Know how to use the equipment (including personalprotective equipment and tools) properly.\nd)Maintain communication with the attendant so that theattendant can monitor your safety and be able to alert\nworkers to evacuate the confined space.\ne)Alert the attendant whenever:\n– you recognize any warning sign or symptom of\n– you see a dangerous condition\n– an alarm is activated.\nf)Get out of the permit space immediately whenever\n– a warning system indicating a ventilation failure is\n– the attendant gives an evacuation order– a worker recognizes any signs or symptoms of\n– a person inside detects a dangerous condition– an evacuation alarm is activated.\n2) COORDINATION\nWhen workers of more than one employer perform work in\nthe same confined space, the constructor must coordinateentry operations.

    "content": "33 – 93) RESCUE PROCEDURES\nThe confined space plan must include written procedures\nfor safe onsite rescue that can be implementedimmediately in case of an emergency. An adequatenumber of people must be available to carry out therescue procedures immediately. They must be trained in\na)the onsite rescue procedures\nb)first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nc)how to use the rescue equipment necessary to carry\nout the rescue.\n4) RESCUE EQUIPMENT\nThe rescue equipment must be readily available,\nappropriate for the confined space, and inspected by acompetent worker. The competent worker must keep awritten record of the inspection. Examples of rescueequipment include harnesses and lifelines, hoist/retrievalsystems, respirators, and other personal protectiveequipment.\nNOTE: Y ou must consider the size of the confined space's\nopening when choosing rescue equipment. There is nopoint planning for a rescuer to wear a SCBA (self-contained breathing apparatus) unit if it doesn't fit throughthe opening.\nAll too often, inadequate or incorrect emergency rescue\nresponse results in multiple fatalities. Here are twoexamples:\n➤A worker collapsed shortly after entering a degasser\ntank. His coworker went in after him and collapsed aswell.\n➤A contractor went to test acid-tainted water and wasdiscovered by a worker floating in a well of the above-ground pump house. The worker went to his rescueafter calling 911 but was himself overcome. Two\nparamedics responding to the call were also struck\ndown. All four victims died.\nEven with the best planned and executed entry there is a\nchance of a sudden change in conditions. The changecould be due to factors recognized earlier but for which no\n“absolute” protection exists, such as the failure of a\nrespirator, the introduction of a new hazard, or collapsefrom heart attack or illness. In such cases you need a\nrescue plan that has been practiced and works. 5) PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND\nPERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT\nProtective clothing and equipment suitable for one\nmaterial may not be suitable for others. For example,polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic is resistant to most acids,but it can be softened or penetrated by many commonsolvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene.\nFor this reason, a knowledgeable person should assess\nthe protective clothing and equipment needed (e.g.,gloves, boots, chemical suits, fire resistant coveralls-aswell as hearing, respiratory, eye, and face protection).Don't forget that if workers need personal protectiveequipment, they must be trained in its use.\nRespiratory protective equipment should be used\nwhere ventilation is impractical or inadequate. Certain\nbasic rules apply to the equipment.\nFirst of all, you need to select the proper type of\nrespirator. Oxygen-deficient atmospheres requiresupplied-air respirators—either airline types withemergency reserves or SCBA (self-contained breathingapparatus) as in the figures on the next page.\nIn toxic atmospheres, you must use supplied-air\nrespirators if the concentration of the gas or vapourexceeds the level considered to be ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH), or if the concentrationis unknown.CONFINED SPACES\nDialing 911 is not a sufficient rescue response.\nSCBA note : Because the amount of air supply in\nstandard SCBA cylinders is rated for a specific timeperiod, it is very important to plan your tasks,especially rescues operations, accordingly. Heavywork and stress will increase breathing rates andworkers will use up the air in less than the ratedtime. An alarm sounds when the air supply is low.\nRemember, rushing into a confined space to helpyour buddy who is laying on the ground will likelyresult in your own death. Rescuers are no good to thevictim if they also become victims. Many cases ofmultiple fatalities involve would-be rescuers overcomebecause of inadequate preparation.",

For example, if a propane heater is being\nused inside a confined space, then you need calibratedmonitors capable of measuring oxygen levels, carbonmonoxide, and combustible gases. You must calibrate, maintain, and use the equipment\nin accordance with the manufacturer'srecommendations.\nIf the meter is not properly calibrated, you cannot rely\nupon its results. Deaths can occur if the instrumentunderestimates the atmospheric conditions. CONFINED SPACES\nWARNING: Combustible gas detectors should notbe used to assess toxic atmospheres. Mostcombustible gas detectors do not respond to lowconcentrations of gases. For example, H2S isflammable from 4.3% to 44%. But it is ImmediatelyDangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) at 100 parts permillion (0.01%) and would not be detected at thisconcentration by most combustible gas detectors.Most other toxic gases that are also flammable aredangerous in concentrations well below the LEL.\nMost confined-spaceinstrumentmanufacturers nowoffer \"docking\"stations that canautomaticallycalibrate instrumentsand print a record ofcalibration.

Atmospheres should beevaluated remotely (from outside the confined space)before each entry. If possible, an extendable probe shouldbe inserted through an inspection port or other openingbefore removing large doors or covers.\nMake sure that as much of the space as possible is\ntested, including the bottom, mid-level, top, and corners,so that you don't miss layers or pockets of bad air. (Seefigure below). There are some gases that are lighter orheavier than air. Lighter gases, such as methane, willaccumulate at the top, while gases heavier than air willsink to floor level. Gases that are the same weight as air,such as carbon monoxide, will be found throughout aconfined space.\nCheck for oxygen content, combustible or explosive\ngases and vapours, and toxic gases and vapours inthat order if you use more than one meter.\nFirst, check for oxygen content. Checking oxygen first is\nimportant because you may need adequate oxygen to geta valid result from other tests.\nIf the oxygen level is adequate, test for explosive\natmospheres.

Theseare referred to as “friable.”\nThe second type includes\nmaterials much more durablebecause they are held togetherby a binder such as cement,vinyl, or asphalt. Theseproducts are termed “non-friable.”\nFriable material was widely\nused to fireproof steelstructures. It can be found onbeams, columns, trusses,hoists, and steel pan floors.Sprayed material was alsoused as a decorative finishand as acoustical insulation on ceilings.\nThe material can be loose,\nfluffy, and lumpy in texture or,if more gypsum was used, itmay be quite hard and durable.CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING\nCertification: Type 3 operations\nAll workers who perform Type 3 asbestos operations—and\nthe supervisors of these workers—must be certified to dotheir work. (Type 3 operations are discussed later in thischapter.) This certification requirement is contained inOntario Regulation 278/05. There are two certificationprograms: one for workers and one for supervisors.Supervisors must complete both the worker program andthe supervisor program. The certification programs mustcomply with the Ministry of Training, Colleges, andUniversities’ training standards for the programs. ContactIHSA for details (1-800-781-2726).\nTraining for any “Type” of asbestosoperation\nWhenever work is planned at a location where asbestos is\npresent, constructors and employers must inform workers\n❑the location of asbestos-containing materials or\nmaterials assumed to contain asbestos\n❑whether the material is friable or non-friable, and\n❑the type of asbestos (e.g., chrysotile, amosite,tremolite, etc.) if the material is sprayed.\nConstructors and employers must then ensure that\nworkers are trained on asbestos hazards and controls asdetailed on the next page.\nEmployers performing regular service or maintenance\nwork on behalf of owners have these same training\nrequirements. Such employers should develop safe workpractices. They should also become familiar with theowner's asbestos procedures and communicate them totheir employees.ASBESTOS\nFriable Materials\nApproved Fireproofing\nAcoustical Coating\nSprayed Fireproofing\nAir-Cell Pipe Insulation\nNon-Friable Materials\nSuspended Ceiling Concealing Fireproofing\nAsbestos-Cement Siding Vinyl Asbestos Floor Tile",

See the section on “Certification: Type 3operations” on the previous page.\nWorkers in any “Type” of asbestos operation—as well as\nother workers who could be exposed to asbestos—must\nbe trained by a competent person on the following:\n❑the hazards of asbestos exposure\n❑the purpose, inspection, maintenance, use, fitting,\ncleaning, disinfecting, and limitations of respirators\n❑personal hygiene and correct procedures for workwith asbestos\n❑how to use, clean, and dispose of protective clothing.\nNote: The above applies to facility owners and tenants\nwhose staff undertake work involving the removal or\ndisturbance of asbestos-containing material or who\ncontract with other employees to do so.\nTraining should also include\n❑methods of recognizing asbestos, including\nidentification of building materials that contain\n❑the relationship between smoking, asbestos, and lung\n❑the kinds of operations that could result in exposureto asbestos\n❑classification of Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 operations\n❑required work procedures and controls to minimizeexposure, including engineering controls, work\npractices, respirators, housekeeping procedures,\nhygiene facilities, protective clothing, decontaminationprocedures, emergency procedures, and waste\ndisposal procedures\n❑the requirements of the medical-surveillance program\n❑the requirements for signs and labels.\nThe joint health and safety committee or the health and\nsafety representative must be informed about when andwhere the training will take place.ENCAPSULATION OR REMOVAL\nIn dealing with asbestos that may be encountered inapplications such as fireproofing and cement, the decisionwhether to encapsulate the material, remove it, or leave it inplace rests with the client/owner.\nMany owners of asbestos-containing buildings have decided\nto reduce the risk of exposure to asbestos. The procedure is\nnormally either removal or encapsulation. Encapsulationmeans spraying an approved sealant onto or into thematerial to prevent the release of fibres into the air in thebuilding.\nEncapsulation is permitted only if the asbestos will not be\ndamaged further in the process.\nRemoval of asbestos is a more permanent solution to the\nproblem. Most removal projects employ the wet removalmethod. Water and a wetting agent are sprayed onto theasbestos. This effectively reduces the quantity of fibresreleased when the material is removed.\nDry removal is normally done only when wet removal is\nunsafe or impractical – for instance in computer rooms or\nother areas where there is a chance of water damage todelicate equipment. Dry removal causes excessively highconcentrations of asbestos fibres (in excess of 100 fibresper cubic centimetre) and may contaminate other previously\n“clean” areas.\nDuring dry removal projects, use an extensive filtered\nexhaust system to create a slight negative air pressure inthe work area. This will reduce the chance of spreading\nasbestos fibres. The requirements for negative air pressure\nare specified in the asbestos regulation.\nAnother solution is to enclose the asbestos with a physical\nbarrier such as drywall. This is normally done where thearea is not going to be entered frequently or altered later.\nThe asbestos regulation specifies what precautions must be\ntaken during removal, encapsulation, or enclosure.ASBESTOS\nSpraying Asbestos Ceiling Material with\nAmended Water Before Wet Removal",

    "content": "35 – 3The biggest uncertainty about the load-bearing capacity of\nice is the natural variation in thickness and quality that\ncan occur over a given area. Currents and springs can\ncause variations in thickness without changing the overallsurface appearance of the ice. Considerable variation inice thickness can occur where rivers have significantcurrents or high banks. Similar situations occur in lakes at\nthe inlet and outlet of rivers.\nOnly the thickness of continuously frozen ice should be\nused to determine bearing capacity. The basis for capacityshould be the minimum thickness measured.\nIn addition to testing for thickness, crews should check ice\nfor cracking.\nIce thickness (Figure 128) is determined by the full\nthickness of clear blue ice plus half the thickness of anywhite,continuouslyfrozen ice\nOperations Over\nIce, Treasury\nBoard of Canada).\nFor repeated work\nor travel over ice,\nthe surface mustbe tested\nregularly to\nensure continuedsafety. Ice mustalso be tested regularly near currents or eddies and\naround permanent structures like abutments.\nBearing Capacity of Ice\nWhere heavy equipment such as cranes or structures suchas concrete forms are to be placed on ice for extended\nperiods, ask an experienced consultant for advice onbearing capacity, load methods, and inspection procedures.\nWith professional advice it is possible to increase bearing\ncapacity considerably. But careful control is required oversurface operations, loading procedures, and ice monitoring.\nIn other cases, refer to Graph 1 for allowable moving\nloads on various thicknesses of clear blue ice. Remember:\nthe graph is not to be used for loads parked, stored, or\notherwise left stationary for long periods of time.\nCertain types of cracking can affect the bearing capacity\nof ice. For a single dry crack wider than 2.5 centimetres (1inch), reduce loads by one third; for intersecting cracks of\nthis size, reduce loads by two thirds. Dry cracks can be\nrepaired by filling in with water or slush. A wet crack indicates penetration through the ice to waterbelow. Bearing capacity can be dangerously lowered. Fora single wet crack, reduce loads by three quarters. Mostwet cracks refreeze as strong as the original ice. A coresample should be taken to determine the depth of healing.\nOther Considerations\n• Ice roads must be at least 40 centimetres (16 inches) thick\nalong their entire length and should be clearly marked.\n• Ice roads should not be built up more than 10 centimetres\n(4 inches) in one day and must not be used or refloodeduntil the top layer has completely frozen.\n• While an ice road is in use it must be checked daily for\nthickness, cracks, thawing, and other conditions.\n• All rescue equipment listed earlier in this chapter must be\nreadily available.\n• A life ring attached to 20 metres (65 feet) of polypropylene\nrescue rope 9.5 millimetres (3/8 inch) thick must be keptwithin 35 metres (115 feet) of the work area.\n• A warm place such as a truck cab or hut must be provided\nand made known to personnel near the worksite.\nFor more information on the bearing capacity of ice,\nsee Safety Guide for Operations Over Ice , by the\nTreasury Board of Canada.\nIce thickness versus ice strength\nThis table provides the safe load for a given ice thickness of\n• fresh ice (lake and river ice) and\n• sea ice (St. Lawrence River, Gulf of St. Lawrence, etc.)\nSAFE LOAD OPERATION FRESH ICE SEA ICE\nOne person at rest 8 cm 13 cm\n0.4 ton moving slowly 10 cm 18 cm\n10 ton tracked moving slowly 43 cm 66 cm\n13 ton aircraft parked 61 cm 102 cm\nTable provided by the National Research Council of Canada.WATER AND ICE\nFigure 127\nFigure 128Recommended Bearing CapacityBased on Experience — Moving Loads Only\nTHICKNESS OF GOOD QUALITY FRESH WATER ICE, cm.LOAD, tons\nLOAD, metric tonnes\nTHICKNESS OF GOOD QUALITY FRESH WATER ICE, inches\nThe allowable load should be reduced by one half\nfor operations on white opaque ice.\nGraph 1 Courtesy Treasury Board of Canada",

Wood\ndust is also very flammable.\nIn construction, saws and other tools are often\noperated in the open air where dust presents no\nhazard. However, dust masks or respirators should\nbe worn whenever ventilation is inadequate.\nStorage areas should be at least 1.8 m (6 ft) away\nfrom roof or floor openings, excavations, or any\nopen edges where material may fall off. Near\nopenings, arrange material so that it cannot roll or\nslide in the direction of the opening.\nSecure loose material such as insulation and sheets\nof plywood to prevent them from blowing away\nin the strong wind (Figure 25-5). After removing\nmaterial, resecure pile.\nFigure 25-5: Secure Loose Material\nAgainst the Wind\nFlammable Materials\n• Use copper grounding straps to keep static\nelectricity from building up in containers, racks,\nflooring, and other surfaces (Figure 25-6).\n• Store fuel only in containers approved by the\nCanadian Standards Association (CSA) or\nUnderwriters’ Laboratories of Canada (ULC).\n• Ensure that electric fixtures and switches are\nexplosion-proof where flammable materials are\n• See Figure 25-7 for pointers on safe storage of\nflammable liquids.",

Secure cylinders upright with\nchains or rope.\n• Lock up cylinders to prevent vandalism and theft.\n• Wherever possible, store cylinders in a secure area\n• Keep full cylinders apart from empty cylinders.\n• Store cylinders of different gases separately.\n• Keep cylinders away from heat sources.\n• When heating with propane, keep 45-kg (100-lb)\ncylinders at least 3 m (10 ft) away from heaters;\nkeep larger tanks at least 7.6 m (25 ft) away.\n• Stack on level sills.\n• Stack reusable lumber according to size and\nlength. Remove nails during stacking.\n• Support lumber at every 1.2-m (4-ft) span.\n• Cross-pile or cross-strip when the pile will be\nmore than 1.2 m (4 ft) high.\nFire Protection\nGood housekeeping is essential for the prevention\nof fires. However, if a fire does break out in the\nworkplace, it is important to know what kind of fire\nextinguisher to use and how to use it.\nSection 52 of the Regulation for Construction\nProjects (213/91) outlines specific locations and\ncircumstances where fire extinguishers must be\n• Where flammable materials are stored, handled,\n• Where temporary oil- or gas-fired equipment is\nbeing used\n• Where welding or open-flame cutting is being\n• On each storey of an enclosed building being\nconstructed or renovated\n• In workshops, for at least every 300 square\nmetres (3,230 square feet) of floor area.\nFire extinguishers must always be\n• Easily accessible\n• Well-maintained\n• Refilled or replaced immediately after use.\nThey must be inspected for defects or deterioration\nonce a month by a competent worker who records\nthe date on the tag.",
