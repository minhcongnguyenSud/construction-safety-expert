Reg. 213/91, \ns.26.1(4)) requires that before \nworkers use any fall arrest system \nor safety net on a project, the \nemployer must develop written \nprocedures for the rescue of \na worker whose fall has been \nSome of the reasons why a suspended worker \nshould be rescued quickly are listed below\n• The worker may have been injured during the fall \nand may need medical attention.\n• The worker may panic if they are left hanging for \na long time.\n• The event that led to the fall may have created \nadditional dangers that need to be dealt with \nright away.\n• The worker may develop suspension trauma if \nthey are hanging in a safety harness for too long. \nSuspension trauma causes the blood to pool in \nthe lower body, depriving the brain of oxygen.\nIn many cases, the rescue plan can be simple. A \nladder or elevated work platform can be used to \nreach suspended workers and get them down \nsafely. In other cases, it makes more sense to haul \nthe worker back up to the level from which they fell \nor pull the worker in through a nearby window or \nother opening.\nFor some projects, the rescue procedures may be \nmore complicated. You may need specially trained \nand equipped rescue workers from the local fire \ndepartment. Aerial ladder trucks or other high-\nreach equipment may be necessary. In extreme \ncases, the fire department may use rappelling \ntechniques to reach trapped workers and lift or \nlower them to a safe place.\nCreate a rescue plan that is specific to your jobsite \nand that covers the different types of fall-related \nrescues that may be necessary. The plan should \ncover the on-site equipment that you will use, the \npersonnel who will use it, and the procedures for \ndifferent types of rescue. \nAny off-site rescue services that might be needed \nshould be contacted in advance to make sure \nthat they have the proper resources available \n(equipment, specially trained personnel, etc). \nThe constructor should make arrangements to \nfamiliarize rescue services with the project and any \nhazards that they may encounter.Once the written rescue plan has been developed, \nmake sure everyone on the site is familiar with it. \nThat’s especially important for any worker who will \nbe using fall protection equipment.\nSample Fall Rescue Procedures \nHere are some examples of general fall rescue \nprocedures that your plan should include.\nA. If an elevating work platform (EWP) is \navailable on site:\n1. Take it to the location of the suspended \n2. Make sure that rescue workers using the \nEWP are protected against falling.\n3. Be sure the EWP has the load capacity for \nboth the rescuer(s) and the victim.\n4. Use the EWP to reach the suspended \n5. Position the EWP platform below the \n6. Disconnect the suspended worker from \ntheir lanyard or lifeline when it is safe to \ndo so. If the worker is unconscious or can’t \nhelp with the rescue, two rescuers may be \nneeded to handle the worker safely.\n7. Treat the worker for suspension trauma and \nany other injuries.\n8. Arrange to take the worker to the nearest \nB. If an elevating work platform is not available:\n1. Where possible, use a ladder (or ladders) to \nreach the suspended worker.\n2. If the suspended worker is not in an area \nthat rescuers can reach by ladders, move \nthe suspended worker by their lifeline to an \narea that can be safely reached by ladder (if \npossible).\n3. Rig a separate lifeline for each rescuer to \nuse while carrying out the rescue.\n4. Position the ladder(s) so that the rescuers \ncan get beneath the suspended worker.\n5. Securely attach a separate lowering line to \nthe suspended worker’s harness.\n6. Rescuers on the ground will lower the \nworker while the rescuers on the ladders \nwill guide the worker. If the suspended \nworker is unconscious or can’t help with \ntheir own rescue, two rescuers may be \nneeded to handle the worker.\n7. Once the worker has been taken to a safe \nlocation, administer first aid for suspension \ntrauma and any other injuries.\n8. Arrange to take the worker to the nearest",

If the injured person is suspended near the \nwork area and can be reached safely from the \nfloor below or from the place from which the \nworker fell:\n1. Make sure that all rescuers are protected \nagainst falling (such as by travel restraint or \nfall arrest).\n2. If possible, attach a second line securely to \nthe worker’s harness to help pull him or her \nto a safe place. At least two strong workers \nwill probably be needed to pull someone up.\n3. Eliminate slack in the retrieving line to avoid \n4. Once the worker has been taken to a safe \nplace, administer first aid for suspension \ntrauma and any other injuries.\n5. Arrange to take the worker to the nearest \nD. If a person has fallen and is suspended in an \ninaccessible place (e.g., on a tower, against \na building, or in a structure that has no \nopenings): \n1. You may need trained personnel and \nspecialized rescue techniques to rescue the \nworker. For example, the rescuer may have \nto lower themself down to the suspended \nworker or use a lifeline to retrieve them.\n2. Because of the inherent risk in this type of \nrescue, only people with specialized training \nshould do it.\nEmergency Rescue in Challenging \nSituations\nCertain circumstances on a jobsite can present a \nchallenge for rescue personnel who may need to \nremove an unconcious or immobile worker from \nan area that is difficult to get to or hard to find. \nAn assessment must be carried out on the various \ntypes of emergencies that may present themselves \non each jobsite. Emergency procedures must then \nbe developed to account for these challenges.\nFor example, special considerations must be \nplanned for any emergency that requires the rescue \nof a worker from the uppermost work level of a \nsuspended slab at night. NOTE: There are differences in equipment \nfrom different manufacturers as well as from \ndifferent product lines in the same company. \nTherefore emergency training must cover \nthe same harness, lanyard, energy absorber, \nrope grab, lifeline, and anchorage that each \nworker will rely on, as well as the ways in \nwhich each will be used.Often, a ladder is the only way to access this type \nof work area. In addition, there may be few, if any, \nworkers in the area during that time to provide \nassistance to rescuers. The injured worker also may \nnot be able to help rescuers due to the nature of \nthe emergency, which could include:\n• A personal medical complication such as a heart \nattack, asthma attack, or allergic reaction\n• A workplace injury from a traumatic incident such \nas being struck by equipment or a tool\n• Illness from exposure to a hazardous product or \nAny delay in response time for rescuing an injured \nworker can have severe consequences. It could \ncause the outcome of an incident to be more \nserious than it otherwise would have been. \nSample Rescue Procedures for the Uppermost \nWork Level of a Suspended Slab at Night\nA. Installing stairs to the uppermost work level\nPlanning the job to ensure that stairs are \ninstalled to the upper most level of a \nsuspended floor can help the process of \nrescuing a worker. Temporary stairs can allow \nfor easy access to the uppermost work level \nfrom a level where permanent stairs or an \nelevator exists. As work levels proceed, these \nstairs could be hoisted up into place to ensure \nthat there is always non-obstructed access in \nthe event a rescue is needed.\nStairs must be designed in accordance with \nsections 75 to 77 of the construction regulation \n(213/91). While a ladder may be acceptable \nfor accessing a single form, temporary or \npermanent stairs may be more appropriate \nwhere a whole slab is in place, which \nconstitutes the uppermost work level.Figure 2-4: Using Temporary Stairs \nCan Provide Easy Access",

    "content": "Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries9\n\nTraumatic events such as falling from a \nheight, getting hit by a motor vehicle, or \nsustaining a powerful blow to the head \ncan cause head, neck, or spinal injuries. \nInjuries to the head or spine can damage \nbones, such as the skull or vertebrae, \nand tissues, such as the brain and the \nspinal cord. Head injuries are often \naccompanied by spinal injuries, but a \nperson with a superficial head wound \nmay also have an underlying head injury.\nDepending on the nature and severity of the injury, the person may be \nleft with permanent damage (e.g., paralysis, speech impairment, memory \nproblems, or behavioural conditions). Although injuries to the head and \nspine account for a small percentage of all injuries, they cause more than \nhalf of the fatalities. \nThe Neck and Spine\nThe spine is a strong, flexible column of small bones called vertebrae; it \nsupports the head and the torso. The spine surrounds and protects the \nspinal cord, which is a bundle of nerves that runs between the brain and \nthe lower back.The spine is divided into four regions:\n1. The cervical (neck) region, which consists of the \nC1 to C7 vertebrae.\n2. The thoracic (chest) region, which consists of the \nT1 to T12 vertebrae.\n3. The lumbar (lower back) region, which consists of \nthe L1 to L5 vertebrae.\n4. The sacrum (hip) and coccyx (tailbone) region, \nwhich consists of the S1 to S5 vertebrae and the \nfour fused vertebrae that form the tailbone.\nSevere injuries can move or break the vertebrae so \nthat they squeeze or cut the spinal cord, causing \ntemporary or permanent paralysis, or even death. \nDamage can also occur if the injury causes the soft \ntissue of the spinal cord to swell, compressing it \nagainst the hard bone that surrounds it. \nDepending on the location and severity of the \ninjury, the person may develop paralysis (the loss of \nmovement, sensation or both) in body parts below \nthe injury. Paraplegia is paralysis that affects both legs \nand the lower trunk. Quadriplegia is paralysis that \naffects both arms, the torso, and both legs. The higher \nup the spine the injury occurs, the more extensive the \nparalysis will be.\nHead, Neck, and Spinal Injuries108",

The severity of a head, neck, \nor spinal injury can only be determined through an evaluation by medical \npersonnel: you should always assume that such an injury is serious.\nThe following signs and symptoms alone do not always indicate a serious \nhead, neck, or spinal injury, but you should call EMS/9-1-1 if any of these \nare present:\n• Changes in level of responsiveness, awareness, and behaviour\n• Drowsiness, confusion, or disorientation\n• Severe pain or pressure in the head, neck, or back\n• Blood or other fluids in the ears or nose\n• Heavy external bleeding from the head, neck, or back\n• Unusual bumps, bruises, or depressions on the head, neck, or back\n• Seizures\n• Impaired breathing or vision\n• Nausea or vomiting\n• Unequal pupil size\n• Persistent headache\n• Partial or complete loss of movement of any body part without an \nobvious traumatic cause (e.g., inability to move a limb that does not \nappear to be injured)\n• Back pain, weakness, tingling, or loss of sensation in the hands, \nfingers, feet, or toes\n• Unusually positioned neck or back\n• Dizziness and/or loss of balance\n• Bruising of the head, especially around the eyes and behind the ears\n• Loss of bladder or bowel control\n• Behaviour similar to that of a person under the influence of alcohol \nor drugs (e.g., stumbling, memory loss, speech problems) 110110\nHead, Neck, and Spinal Injuries110",

Then the box should be lowered into thetrench (Figure 13).\nTrench boxes\nTrench boxes are not usually intended to shore\nup or otherwise support trench walls. They aremeant to protect workers in case of a cave-in.\nDesign drawings and specifications for trench\nboxes must be signed and sealed by theprofessional engineer who designed the systemand must be kept on site by the constructor.\nBoxes are normally placed in an excavated but\nunshored trench and used to protect personnel.A properly designed trench box is capable ofwithstanding the maximum lateral load expectedat a given depth in a particular soil condition.\nTrenches near utilities, streets, and buildings\nmay require a shoring system.\nAs long as workers are in the trench they\nshould remain inside the box. Workers must notbe inside the trench or the box when the box isbeing moved. A ladder must be set up in thetrench box at all times.Excavation should be done so that the space\nbetween the trench box and the excavation isminimized (Figure 14).\nThe two reasons for this are\n1)allowing closer access to the top of the\n2)limiting soil movement in case of a \nCheck the drawings and specifications for the\ntrench box to see if the space between the boxand the trench wall needs to be backfilled andthe soil compacted.\nShoring is a system which “shores” up orsupports trench walls to prevent movement ofsoil, underground utilities, roadways, andfoundations.\nShoring should not be confused with trench\nboxes. A trench box provides worker safety butgives little or no support to trench walls orexisting structures such as foundations andmanholes.\nThe two types of shoring most commonly used\nare timber and hydraulic.

Precautions specifically developed forsuch construction must be taken before work begins.\nThis chapter outlines general safeguards that must be\nfollowed whenever personnel are required to work over\nwater or on ice, including construction on bridges,wharves, dams, locks, and breakwaters.\nGuardrails\nThe requirements for guardrails specified in this manualand in Section 26 of the Construction Regulation apply to\nwork stations over water or ice.\nRamps must be\n– at least 46 centimetres (18 inches) wide\n– not sloped more than 1 in 3 (20 degrees) and– where slope exceeds 1 in 8 (6 degrees), have cleats\n19 x 38 millimetres (1 inch by 2 inches) secured atregular intervals not more than 50 centimetres (20inches) apart.\nWhen a ramp is used for equipment such aswheelbarrows and a worker may fall from the ramp adistance of 1.2 metres (4 feet) or more — or may fall any\ndistance into water — the ramp must be provided with\nguardrails (Figure 122).\nFloating Work Platforms\nWhen used on a construction project, rafts, scows, and\nsimilar vessels are considered work platforms. As such,they are subject to certain requirements.\n• Guardrails must be provided along open edges. The\nguardrails may be removed at the working side of the\nplatform, provided workers are protected by alternatemeasures of fall protection.\n• Workers on floating platforms must wear lifejackets. A\nlifejacket provides enough buoyancy to keep thewearer's head above water, face up, without effort bythe wearer.\n• Appropriate rescue measures must be prepared.\nIn addition, the positioning and securing of vessels used\nas work platforms should be supervised and undertakenby experienced personnel.\nFall-Arrest Systems\nThe requirements specified in the chapters on Guardrailsand Personal Fall Protection in this manual apply to workover water or ice.\nSafety Nets\nSafety nets may be necessary when structural design,loading access, worker mobility, or other factors makeguardrails and fall-arrest systems impractical (Figure 123).\nSafety nets must be\n• designed, tested, and installed in accordance with\nANSI Standard 10.11-1989, \nPersonnel and Debris\nNets for Construction and Demolition Operations\n• installed by a competent worker\n• inspected and tested by a professional engineer or\ncompetent person under the engineer's supervisionbefore the net is put into service.WATER AND ICE\nMaximum Ramp Slope1\nFigure 122\nFigure 123\nRescue Boat",
