Where PPE is reliedupon for worker protection, an electricalhazard is considered to remain and it is stillnecessary to address safety requirements forother workers in the area.\nInjuries resulting from a worker makingelectrical contact represent a relatively smallportion (7.7%) of the lost-time injurieselectricians experience, according to 1997–1999statistics. It is reasonable to assume that thesituation is similar today. Other mechanicaltrades that do some electrical work canprobably expect even fewer electrical injuries. Nevertheless, working on or near electricalhazards is dangerous and can be fatal. Anywork on or near energized equipment must bedone only when measures are in place toprovide protection from electric shock and burn.With adequate safety measures in place, everyelectrical injury and fatality can be prevented. \nThe law requires safe work practices. Under the\nOccupational Health and Safety Act andRegulations for Construction Projects , employers,\nsupervisors, and workers each have legalresponsibilities to ensure that work is beingcarried out in a safe manner. \nThere are also restrictions in the Construction\nRegulation (Ontario Regulation 213/91 Section182) on who can work on electrical equipment:\n(1) No worker shall connect, maintain, or\nmodify electrical equipment or installationsunless,\n(a) the worker is an electrician certified\nunder the Trades Qualification andApprenticeship Act; or\n(b) the worker is otherwise permitted to\nconnect, maintain or modify electricalequipment or installations under theTrades Qualification and ApprenticeshipAct, the Apprenticeship and CertificationAct, 1998 or the Technical Standardsand Safety Act, 2000.\n(2) A worker who does not meet the\nrequirements of clause (1) (a) or (b) mayinsert an attachment plug cap on the cordof electrical equipment or an electrical toolinto, or remove it from, a conveniencereceptacle. \nGuidelines for working on or near electricalequipment and conductors are found in severaldocuments:\n• Construction Regulation (O.

A reference fordetailed information on lockout and control ofhazardous energy is the Canadian standard CSAZ460-05, Control of Hazardous Energy—Lockout\nand Other Methods. \nELECTRICAL INJURIES\nThere are basically two ways to be injured byelectricity. One is by electric shock and theother is by arc flash.\nElectric shock is the passing of electric current\nthrough the body. Electrical contact can causeinvoluntary physical movements. The electricalcurrent may \n• prevent you from releasing your grip from\na live conductor\n• throw you into contact with a higher\nvoltage conductor\n• cause you to lose your balance and fall\n• cause severe internal and external burns• kill you. \nA household 125-volt circuit can deliver 15 \namps. Current as low as 30/1000 of 1 amp (30 mA) can cause breathing to stop. A 15-Amp circuit contains many times the currentneeded to cause death.An arc flash is a release\nof energy caused by anelectric arc. The flashcauses an explosiveexpansion of air andmetal. The blast produces \n• a dangerous pressure\n• a dangerous sound\n• shrapnel\n• extreme heat• extreme light.\nThese dangers can result\nin blast injuries, lunginjuries, rupturedeardrums, shrapnelwounds, severe burns, andblindness.

Multimeters that aredesigned to meet the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 1010 andovervoltage category standards, when properlyused, offer the electrician an acceptable level ofprotection that is recognized by the electricalindustry. The use of fused leadsprovides additional protectionfor the worker. \nWhy use overvoltage\ncategory rated multimeters?\nMomentary high-voltage\ntransients or spikes can travelthrough a multimeter at any timeand without warning. Motors,capacitors, lightning, and powerconversion equipment such asvariable speed drives are allpossible sources of spikes.The IEC 1010 standard defines categories I throughIV that are abbreviated as CAT I, CAT II, CAT III,etc. The higher-numbered categories represent anelectrical environment that is susceptible to higher-energy spikes. For example, multimeters that aredesigned to the CAT IV standard provide theworker more protection from high transient voltagespikes than do CAT III, CAT II, or CAT I designs.See the diagram on the next page and Table 3below for an explanation of each category.\nBe sure that the multimeter model has been\ntested. Simply being designed to the CAT IIIstandard, for example, does not mean themultimeter was also tested to that standard.\nLook for proof of independent testing byan organization accredited by theStandards Council of Canada, suchas the CSA (Canadian StandardsAssociation) International logo,along with the appropriatecategory rating on the equipment. \nReprinted in part with permission of Fluke Electronics Canada Inc.A failed multimeterTable 3",

A higher CAT number refers to anelectrical environment with higher poweravailable and higher-energy transients.Therefore, a multimeter designed to the CAT IIIstandard is resistant to much higher-energytransients than one designed to the CAT IIstandard. Categories I through IV apply to low\nvoltage (less than 1000 V) test equipment. \nSafe use of multimeters\n• Use only multimeters that display both the\nCSA logo (or equivalent) andthe CAT (I,\nII, III, or IV) designation. Categories I\nthrough IV apply to low voltage (less than1000 V) test equipment.\n• Check to ensure that the meter’s voltage\nrating is appropriate for the work beingdone. Be aware of multimeters with\nmaximum voltage ratings typical of othercountries (550 V for example). \n• Use personal protective equipment such as\narc flash fire-resistant clothing; eye andface protection; long sleeve shirts;dielectric safety boots; rubber gloves withleather protectors; and mats, blankets, orshields as required. \nDo not wear\nsynthetic inner or outer clothing thatcan melt if an arc flash occurs.\n• Check the manufacturer’s manual for\nspecial cautions. Moisture and cold mayaffect the performance of your meter. \n• Wipe the multimeter and test leads clean\nto remove any surface contamination priorto use.\n• Use fused test leads. Ensure fused leads\nand internal probe fuses are rated as highas or higher than the equipment you aregoing to work on. A minimum of 30 kA isrecommended (200 kA is desirable).\n• Ensure that test leads are in the correct\ninput jacks. \n• When the values to be measured are\nuncertain, start testing with high ranges ofthe multimeter, then move to the lowerranges.\n• Connect to the ground first, and disconnect\nfrom ground last.\n• Test the multimeter on a known power\nsource to verify that the meter isfunctioning properly before and aftertesting the suspect circuit, using the samepower function for all three tests. \nUsing a meter to confirm zero energyfor a lockout\nSet the meter to the power function to be usedfor validating the zero energy.

Serious orfatal accidents can occur when people assume thatmachinery is turned off or made harmless—\nbut it isn’t . \nLockout is a procedure that prevents the release of\nhazardous energy. It often involves workers using a\npadlock to keep a switch in the “off” position, or to isolate\nthe energy of moving parts. This prevents electric shock,sudden movement of components, chemical combustion,falling counterweights, and other actions that canendanger lives. Lockout is a physical way to ensure thatthe energy source is de-energized, deactivated, orotherwise inoperable. \nTagging tells others that the device is locked out, who\nhas locked it out, and why. Tagged devices and systems\nmust not be re-energized without the authority of thosenamed on the tag.\nFORMS OF ENERGY\nWhen most people think of uncontrolled hazardousenergy, they think of electricity. But construction crewsdoing work in industrial or office settings often have tolock out and tag a variety of energy sources. Here are themain types.\n•Electrical—electrical panels, generators, lighting \nsystems, etc.\n•Mechanical (the energy of moving parts)—flywheels,\nblades, fans, conveyor belts, etc.\n•Potential (stored energy that can be released during \nwork)—suspended loads, compressed air, electrical capacitors, accumulated bulk goods, coiled springs, chemical reactions, changing states (solid—liquid—gas), etc.\n•Hydraulic —presses, rams, cylinders, cranes, forklifts,\n•Pneumatic—lines, compression tanks, tools, etc.\n•Thermal—steam, hot water, fire, etc. \n•Chemical—flammable materials, corrosive substances, vapours, etc. \nSome equipment may involve more than one type of\nenergy, and pose unexpected hazards. For example, a\nmachine may have an electrically operated componentwith a hydraulic or pneumatic primary power source, or it\nmay become activated on a timed schedule. With someequipment, gravity and momentum can presentunexpected hazards. \nY ou must recognize and control conditions such as these.\nSwitches, power sources, controls, interlocks, pneumatics,hydraulics, computer-controlled sources, gravity-operatedsources—all of these must be locked out andappropriately tagged by each worker involved. \nMany plants or industrial establishments will have specificprocedures for lockout and tagging. This makes sensebecause the in-plant workforce will have proven itsprocedures through use on the particular system ormachine in question. \nFollow these procedures, but also verify that all energy\nsources have been isolated because construction workmay differ from routine plant maintenance. \nPlant personnel may shut down machines, equipment, or\nprocesses. In other cases, plant representatives mayissue permits: 1) a work permit to allow work on theirequipment and 2) a lockout permit to ensure that alllockout procedures are followed before work begins. \nA written safe work procedure for lockout and tagging is\nessential. Once implemented and followed, a goodprocedure ensures that no form of energy can harmanyone during a lockout.\nA written procedure helps to ensure that lockout and\ntagging have been thoroughly and effectively carried outbefore work begins. It should include\n• training requirements for workers and supervisors\n• quality, type, and colour of locks, scissors, chains, \nblanks, blinds, and other lockout devices \n• method of identifying lock owners• control of keys for locks• colour, shape, size, and material for tags• method of securing tags and information to be \n• communication and authorization procedure for \nshutting down and starting up machinery and \n• record-keeping requirements\n• itemized steps to meet lockout objectives.

Identify theequipment that is the subject of the work.\nSTEP 2: IDENTIFY ALL ENERGY SOURCES\nIdentify all energy sources affecting the equipment or\nmachinery. Identify the various energy forms to be lockedout such as electrical, momentum, pneumatic, hydraulic,steam, and gravity.\nSTEP 3: IDENTIFY THE PARTS TO BE LOCKED OUT\nOR ISOLATED\nIdentify systems that affect, or are affected by, the work\nbeing performed. These may include primary, secondary,backup, or emergency systems and interlocked remoteequipment.\nReview the current system drawings for remote energy\nsources and, where required, identify and confirm with theclient or owner the existence and location of any switches,power sources, controls, interlocks, or other devicesnecessary to isolate the system.\nRemember that equipment may also be affected by\n• time restrictions for completing the work\n• time-activated devices.\nSTEP 4: DETERMINE LOCKOUT METHODS\nConfirm that the lockout of all energy sources is possible. \nSome equipment may have to be kept operational to\nmaintain service to other equipment that cannot be shutdown. Take appropriate steps to provide protection forworkers while working near operating equipment. \nEquipment that can be locked out should be locked out by\nthe methods most appropriate to the hazards.\nSTEP 5: NOTIFY ALL PERSONNEL AFFECTED\nShutting down equipment may affect operations in other\nlocations, incoming shifts, or other trades who may beplanning to operate the locked-out system. Beforeproceeding with the lockout, inform all personnel who willbe affected. \nAt construction sites with a large workforce or at relatively\nlarge factories, you may need to have specialcommunication methods and permits or approvals.STEP 6: SHUT DOWN EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY\nQualified personnel must shut down the equipment,\nmachinery, or other system components, placing them ina zero-energy state. Trace all systems to locate and lockout energy sources. The main source may be electrical,for instance, but pneumatic and other forms of energymay also be present. Always look for other possibleenergy sources.\nAll equipment capable of being energized or activated\nelectrically, pneumatically, or hydraulically must be de-energized or de-activated by physically disconnecting or\notherwise making the apparatus inoperable.\nAlways ensure that the client and operators are aware of\nthe plan to shut down and lock out equipment, machinery,or other system components. In some cases, operationspersonnel or equipment operators may be required to shutdown components because of their special qualificationsor knowledge of the system. \nIn determining what needs to be shut down and locked\nout, consider the different energy sources that may befound in the system. \nSTEP 7: INSTALL LOCKOUT DEVICES\nAfter the circuit has been de-energized and locked out\nby the person in charge, each worker involved in thelockout must be protected by placing his or herpersonal lock on the isolating device.\nRemember —even though the disconnect is already locked\nout, you are not protected until you attach your ownpersonal safety lock.\nEach worker must retain his or her key while the lock is in\nplace. Only the worker in charge of the lock should have akey.\nRemember . . . \n• Merely removing a fuse \ndoesn’t constitute lockout. \nThe fuse could be easily replaced. The fuse should be removed and the box locked out. \n• The lockout devices \nattached to one system should not prevent access to the controls and energy-isolating devices of another system.\nLocks should be high-quality pin-type,\nkey-operated, and numbered to identifyusers. \nMultiple locks and lockout bars\nWhen several workers or trades are working on a\nmachine, you can add additional locks by using a lockoutbar. Y ou can add any number of locks by inserting anotherlockout bar into the last hole of the previous bar.LOCKOUT AND TAGGING\nIn-plant procedures specified by the owner or clienttake precedence over the procedures outlined here,provided there is no contravention of existing codes orlaws.",

Reg.\n213/91) requires each worker involved in a lockoutoperation to attach a durable tag to his or her personallock. The tag must identify the worker’s name, theworker’s employer, the date and time of lockout, the workarea involved, and the reason for the lockout.\nA tag in itself offers no guarantee that a machine or\nsystem is locked out. It simply provides information.\nSigns must be placed on the system indicating that\n• it must not be energized or operated \n• guards, locks, temporary ground cables, chains, tags, \nand other safeguards must not be tampered with or \nremoved until \na) the work is complete, and \nb) each worker has removed his or her personal \nA record must be kept of all equipment locked out or\notherwise rendered inoperable so that all of these devicescan be reactivated once the work is complete.STEP 9: VERIFY ZERO-ENERGY STATE\nAfter any power or product remaining in the equipment\nhas been discharged or disconnected by qualifiedpersonnel, verify that all personnel are clear of theequipment. Then try, with extreme caution, to start theequipment manually. Look for any movement or functions.If none are observed, confirm that all energy sources areat a zero-energy state.\nTest the system to ensure that all electrical components\nare de-energized and de-activated, including interlockingand dependent systems that could feed into the system,either mechanically or electrically. \nSTEP 10: PERFORM THE TASK\nCarry out and complete the work assignment.\nSTEP 11: COMMUNICATE THAT WORK IS COMPLETE\nAND THAT ALL PERSONNEL ARE CLEAR \n• Ensure that personnel are clear of the locked-out \nequipment, machinery, or system.\n• Remove only your tags and locks.\n• Tell personnel that were originally informed of the \nlockout that the equipment, machinery, or system is \nno longer locked out.\nSTEP 12: RESTORE POWER\nReturn systems to operational status and the switches to\npower ON. Have qualified personnel restart machinery orequipment. \nSTEP 13: RETURN CONTROL TO OPERATING\nWhen all work is completed, the person in charge of the\nlockout operation should formally return control of theequipment or system to plant personnel.\nSTEP 14: RECORD DATE/TIME LOCKOUT REMOVED\nAND SYSTEM RESTORED\nThis last step is important. It saves valuable information\nthat may be lost if not recorded. Staff involved in theshutdown may not remain at the same jobsite. Owners oroperators may require this information to help plan futureshutdowns.\nLockout can ensure the safety of a single mechanic\nworking alone or of hundreds of workers in a factory. Ineither situation, a procedure for safe lockout and taggingmust be written, implemented, and followed step by step.\nLockout and tagging procedures help to ensure that \n• all energy sources are identified and locked out\n• energy is not inadvertently restored while work is \nproceeding\n• maintenance, repair, installation, and other jobs can \nbe carried out safely\n• records are kept.

Combined withoxygen in a manner similar to oxyacetylene welding, itprovides a gas mix that is considered much more stable bymany users.\nWhile welding cylinders are generally smaller than cylinders\nused for construction heaters, they should be treated withthe same care.\n• Fittings should be clean and\nfree of grease before hooking\n• Fitting wrenches should be\nused to avoid damage toparts.\n• Cylinders should be in an\nupright position at all times,kept in a suitable cradle whenin use, and preferably tiedupright to prevent tipping over(Figure 9).\n• A fire extinguisher (4A40BC\nminimum) should be keptclose when using any torch.\n• Regulators should be\nremoved and stored in aprotective case when not in use, along with hoses andtorches.\n• Consult manufacturer's handbook for oxypropane\nregulator settings. They are very different fromoxyacetylene settings. For more information, refer to\nWelding and Cutting in this manual.Summary\nThe safe use of propane depends on twelve basic rules:\n1) Don't store cylinders inside a building.\n2) Remove cylinders from the building when not in use or\nwhen empty.\n3) Keep cylinders away from heat sources, and\nflammables away from heaters.\n4) Always secure cylinders to prevent upset.5) Never transport cylinders in an enclosed vehicle or\n6) Always use proper gear for hoisting or moving cylinders\naround the worksite.\n7) Keep heaters in good condition. Repairs and\nmaintenance should be done only by licensed service\npersonnel.\n8) Always have a fire extinguisher handy (4A40BC\n9) Protect stored cylinders or bulk tanks from on-site\n10) Don't tamper with controls or safety devices.\n11) Never enter an area where leaking gas is suspected.12) Don't use or store cylinders of propane in low areas\nsuch as trenches, maintenance holes, or basements.PROPANE\nOxypropane Welding Cart",

Someone who is competent in respiratorselection must determine the appropriate type ofrespirator.\nWorkers required to wear respirators must be instructed\nhow to properly fit and maintain them. For moreinformation on respiratory protection, refer to the chapteron Respiratory Protection in this manual, or the CanadianStandards Association’s standard Z94.4-02, \nSelection,\nUse, and Care of Respirators .\n6) ISOLATION OF ENERGY ANDCONTROL OF MATERIAL MOVEMENT\nEquipment that moves in any way (even rotation) must beisolated by \n❑disconnecting the equipment from its power source\nand de-energizing the equipment, or\n❑lockout and tagging. Only workers trained in lockoutand tagging should perform such operations. Lockout\nand tagging should be done even if you use the first\noption (disconnect and de-energize) to isolate theenergy.For pneumatic or hydraulic equipment, isolate the power\nsource and depressurize the supply lines. Depressurizeany components that may still be pressurized after thesupply lines have been bled-hydraulic cylinders forexample. Y ou must disconnect and drain pipes carryingsolids or liquids to or from a confined space, or insertblank flanges.\nIf the pipe cannot be blanked off or disconnected, the\nvalve may be closed, chained, locked and tagged,provided thatthis type ofcontrol—and itsimportance—have beenexplained to allworkers in thearea. Simply\nclosing valvesis notgenerallyacceptable. \nY ou may need blocking to prevent movement caused by\ngravity for some equipment (e.g., conveyors). \nElectrical equipment in the\nspace should bedisconnected, tagged andlocked out, and groundedwhen it's practical to do so. \nIn the case of live electrical\nwork in a confined space,you need to pay specialattention to standardprocedures. A minormistake in a manhole canlead to disaster. \nCramped working\nconditions can makeaccidental contact with anenergized conductor morelikely, so you may need non-conductive equipment. \nY ou may need gloves, mats, and other insulating\nequipment depending upon the type of work. Capacitorsor other components which can store a charge should bedischarged and/or grounded.CONFINED SPACES\nDo not use single-strap dust masks and surgical\nmasks—they are not approved by the National\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health\n(NIOSH). NIOSH is a U.S.-based organization thatapproves respirators. Workers must be supplied withNIOSH-approved respirators only. All NIOSH-\napproved respirators have an approval number\n(always starting with the letters TC) on them.\nMake sure your respirator has all the proper parts.\nSince each manufacturer uses different designs,parts are not interchangeable between brands. Make\nsure you use the correct parts (cartridges, aircylinders, etc.) for your brand of respirator. Never\nuse cartridges or air cylinders from another\nmanufacturer. They will not fit correctly and will\nendanger the life of the worker or rescuer.",

In doubtful cases, it is best toimplement the appropriate controls discussed in thefollowing section.\nRecording the results.\nThe test results must be recorded on the work entry\npermit. The records must be kept by the constructor oremployer for at least one year after the project is finished. 10) COMBUSTIBLE, EXPLOSIVE, ORFLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERES\nNo worker is allowed to enter a confined space if airbornecombustible dust or mist is present in a concentration\nsufficient for explosion. If an explosive or flammable\natmosphere is detected, you can perform only certaintypes of work. The conditions for each type of work arespecified below the following definitions.\na)Between 0% and 5% of the LEL, you can perform hot\nwork. The following conditions must also be met:\n❑The oxygen content must be maintained below\n❑The atmosphere must be continuoouslymonitored.\n❑The entry permit must include adequateprovisions for hot work, and it must specify the\nappropriate measures to be taken.\n❑An alarm and exit procedure must be in place to\nprovide adequate warning and allow safe escape\nif the atmospheric concentration exceeds 5% ofthe LEL or if the oxygen content exceeds 23%. \nb)Between 0% and 10% of the LEL, you can perform\ncold work. \nc)Between 0% and 25% of the LEL, you can performinspection work. \nAlternatively, work may be carried out in the confined\nspace if the combustible, explosive or flammableatmosphere is rendered inert by an inert gas (such asnitrogen, argon, helium, or carbon dioxide). \nThe atmosphere must be monitored continuously to\nensure it remains inert. The worker in the confined spacemust use adequate respiratory equipment as well asadequate equipment to help people outside the confinedspace locate and rescue the worker if a problem occurs.CONFINED SPACES\nAcceptable atmospheric levels\nExplosive orflammable gasor vapour< 25% of its lower explosive limit:inspection work can be performed.\n< 10% of its lower explosive limit:\ncold work can be performed. (Cold\nwork is work which does not involve \n – welding and cutting \n – the use of tools or equipment\nwhich can produce a spark\n – other sources of ignition.)\n< 5% of its lower explosive limit: hot\nwork can be performed.\nOxygen contentAt least 19.5% but not more than23% by volume.\nExposure toatmosphericcontaminantsExposures to atmosphericcontaminants must not exceed whatis reasonable in the circumstances(section 221.2 (c) of theConstruction Regulation). \nThe exposure limits in the\nregulation on Control of Exposureto Biological or Chemical Agents(Ontario Regulation 833) and theDesignated Substance Regulations*are generally consideredreasonable for protecting workers. \n* This is the case despite the fact that construction projects are, \nstrictly speaking, exempt from Regulation 833 and most of the\nDesignated Substance Regulations. (The Designated Substance\nRegulation which does apply to construction is O. Reg. 278/05:\nDesignated Substance–Asbestos on Construction Projects and in\nBuildings and Repair Operations.)\n★Never trust your senses to determine whether\nthe atmosphere in a confined space is safe.\n★Y ou cannot see or smell many toxic gases andvapours.\n★Y ou cannot determine by your senses the levelof oxygen present.\n★Know which gases or vapours may be present inthe confined space and test for them.Inerting is the process of replacing the potentially\ncombustible atmosphere in a confined space with a\nnoncombustible gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium,or carbon dioxide.

    "content": "33 – 1511. VENTILATION/PURGING \nThis is the most effective method of control. The space\ncan be purged of dangerous atmospheres by blowingenough fresh air in, and/or by removing (or suction-venting) the bad air and allowing clean air in. Studies haveshown that the best results are obtained by blowing freshair into a space close to the bottom. Check the efficiencyof ventilation by re-testing the atmosphere with the gasdetection equipment before entry.\nWhen ventilation is used to improve the air in a confined\nspace, ensure that the toxic or flammable gases orvapours removed from the space do not pose a risk toother workers. “Exhaust air” should not be discharged intoanother work area. \nIn cases where the\nconcentration of\nexplosive gas or vapouris higher than the UEL,ventilation will bring theconcentration down intothe “Explosive Range.”This is one reason whyyou should use only“explosion-proof” fans.These may be speciallydesigned fans poweredby electricity orcompressed air. Somepneumatic air moversmay also be suitable.\nFor manholes, you can\nuse portable fans. Theseusually provide around750-1,000 cubic feet ofair per minute.A typical manhole 10 feet deep and 5 feet wide contains196 cubic feet. Blowing in 750 cubic feet per minuteshould provide an air change every 15 seconds and easilydilute or displace most dangerous atmospheres.\nFans capable of moving 5,000 cubic feet per minute are\navailable for use in larger tanks and vessels.\nThis type of ventilation may not be adequate in situations\nwhere additional toxic or explosive gases or vapours maybe generated (e.g., during cleaning and resurfacing tanksor by disturbing sludge and scale).\nIn the case of welding or other work which generates a\nlocalized source of toxic gas, fume, or vapour, an exhaustventilator can be used to draw out and discharge thehazard in an open area. (See figure below.)\nOptions must be evaluated by someone who understands\nthe risks of the work being done. CONFINED SPACES\nThe inert gas will replace all of the oxygen as well\nas the combustible gases in the confined space.Workers entering the confined space should useNIOSH-approved \nair-supplied respirators. After\nwork is completed, the confined space must beproperly ventilated, and a competent worker musttest the confined space to see if it is safe.\nIf you use mechanical ventilation to maintainacceptable atmospheric levels by providing acontinuous supply of fresh air, you must have awarning system (i.e., an alarm) and exit procedure incase there is a ventilation failure. The alarm shouldbe activated by a pressure switch at the fan rather\nthan by electrical failure. This ensures that the alarmis activated if the fan belt fails.",
