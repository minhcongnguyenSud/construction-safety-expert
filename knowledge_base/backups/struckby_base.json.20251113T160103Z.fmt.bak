    "content": "Legal Requirements 2-5EMERGENCY PROCEDURES B. Basket rescue with a crane In some cases a worker can be rescued using a basket and crane. Consult section 153 of the construction regulation before using this option to rescue a worker. Also, consider the following factors: • A crane operator must be readily available to operate the crane. • The basket used must be designed by a professional engineer in accordance with good manufacturing processes to withstand all loads to which it may be subjected. • The basket must be kept on-site at all times in an accessible location where it is clear of material or other equipment. • The rescue basket must be equipped with appropriate rigging for quick hookup by the crane operator. • The maximum number of people the basket may hold must be adhered to, as indicated on the nameplate of the basket. • A competent worker must inspect the crane and equipment prior to lifting rescuers. • The crane must be equipped with a fail- safe mechanism to prevent the boom from descending in the event of a power source or system failure. • An adequate means of communication must be maintained between the rescuers in the basket and the crane operator at all times. • Workers in the rescue basket must wear full- body harnesses attached to a lanyard and anchored to appropriate points in the basket at all times. • All rigging used to attach the rescue basket to the hook of a load line must have a safety factor of 10 against failure. A safety line must be attached to the load line directly from the • Environmental factors that could impact the safety of workers in the basket must be taken into consideration, such as high winds, snow, ice, or sleet.NOTE: Basket rescue with a crane may not be possible in circumstances where the deck advances over floors. C. Using an elevating work platform In some cases an elevating work platform (EWP) could be to rescue a worker from the uppermost work level. The EWP must be positioned on the floor below the uppermost work level and in an area above which an opening exists that is large enough to accommodate its platform when raised into In the event that a worker needs to be rescued, the platform can be raised to the opening and the worker can be moved onto its platform. The platform is lowered to a position where rescue personnel can safely remove the worker from the workplace. Before using this rescue method, consult sections 143–149 of the construction regulation (213/91). Also, be aware that the EWP must be continuously hoisted to the floor below the uppermost work level. D. Using a mechanical rescue/descent device Mechanically assisted rescue devices can be used to lower a worker from the uppermost level of a suspended slab to a lower level where rescue personnel can get to the worker and provide medical aid as necessary. These systems typically require workers on the uppermost level to wear a full-body harness. Rescue personnel attach the device’s lifeline from an anchor point to the D-ring on the worker’s full-body harness. The worker is then lowered to a more accessible work platform. Always consult the manufacturer’s instructions before using this type of equipment. Figure 2-5: EWPs Can Be Used During RescueKnow the Law 75. (2) As the construction of a building or structure progresses, permanent or temporary stairs shall be installed up to, (a) the uppermost work level; or (b) if stairs would interfere with work on the uppermost work level, no more than two storeys or nine metres below the uppermost work level, whichever distance is shorter. – O.

Prevention To reduce the risk of amputation: • Keep hands clear of doors when they are closing. • Use caution near train tracks: only cross at designated crossings, and never walk along the tracks. • Be extremely careful when on or around any farm machinery, even when it is turned off or not operating. What to Do If the body part is still partially connected to the body, put it back into place as best you can and treat the injury as an open wound or fracture. Call EMS/9-1-1. 1. Try to control the bleeding with direct pressure. If you are not successful, or you are unable to apply direct pressure, apply a tourniquet.2. Even if the body part has been fully amputated, there is still the possibility that it could be reattached as long as it is cared for properly. Remember to \"protect it, bag it, cool it, tag it:\" PROTECT IT: Wrap the amputated part in gauze or a clean cloth.BAG IT: Place the amputated part in a plastic bag. COOL IT: Keep the amputated part cool by placing the bag on ice. Wrap the bag before cooling it so that the body part does not freeze.TAG IT: Label the container with the person’s name, the date, and the time. 3.

    "content": "Chest Injuries Chest injuries can impact the ribs and/or the organs they protect. They can involve open wounds or internal injuries. If ribs are broken, they can penetrate the skin or the lungs, causing additional injury. Injuries to the chest can result in conditions known as pneumothorax (air in the chest) or hemothorax (blood in the chest). Crush Injuries Common Causes A crush injury occurs when there is a great deal of pressure on a part of the body, such as when a body part is squeezed between two heavy objects. What to Look For If the person is still trapped under the object(s) or between two objects, it is likely that a crush injury has occurred. Other signs and symptoms of a crush injury include the following: • Internal bleeding • Deformity What to Do Call EMS/9-1-1 and get an AED. 1. If the object is restricting the person’s breathing, or the object is crushing the person’s head, neck, chest, or abdomen, remove the object if it can be safely removed. If it is crushing another body part, leave the object where it is until EMS personnel arrive.CarePneumothorax is a condition in which air enters the chest cavity from the wound site but doesn’t enter the lung. The air in the chest cavity presses against the lung, causing it to collapse. Hemothorax is a condition in which blood accumulates in the chest cavity from the wound site but doesn’t get into the lung. Because blood takes up space in the chest cavity, the lung can’t expand effectively. Wound Care103.",

The size of a \"goose egg\" isn’t necessarily an indication of the severity of a head injury. Watch for other signs of injury. You can put ice on a swollen area to reduce its size.The Brain The brain is the centre of the nervous system. It is the master organ that controls all body functions. The brain has the consistency of gelatin, but it is cushioned from everyday bumps and jolts by the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull. Because the skull is hard, there is not much room for the brain to move or swell. Brain injuries can occur as a result of a blow to the head, a penetrating injury to the head (such as a bullet wound), or exposure to acceleration- deceleration forces that cause the head to snap forward and then back. A blow to the head can lead to a concussion (a traumatic brain injury that alters the way it functions), a brain contusion (bruising of the brain tissue) or a brain hematoma (bleeding into the space between the brain and the skull, which increases the pressure inside the skull and damages brain Common Causes Many different situations can lead to head, neck, or spinal injuries: • Motor vehicle collisions • Recreation and sports injuries • Blow to the head or back • Violent acts, such as assault You should suspect a head, neck, and/or spinal injury in the following situations: • A fall from any height greater than the height of the person • Any diving injury (e.g., diving head-first into shallow water) • A person found unresponsive for unknown reasons • Any injury that involves a strong blow to the lower jaw, head, or torso (e.g., colliding with another participant while playing a sport) Prevention The following tips help to prevent head, neck, and spinal injuries: • Wear safety belts with shoulder restraints when in a vehicle. • Children and babies should always ride in approved safety seats. Make sure the seat is designed for the child’s age and weight and make sure it is properly installed. • Wear all recommended protective equipment for the activity you are engaged in (e.g., approved bicycle Head, Neck, and Spinal Injuries109.",

    "content": "28 – 128 BACKING UP Reversing vehicles and equipment on construction projects pose a serious problem for personnel onfoot. Fatal accidents resulting from workers being backed over by dump trucks and other equipment occur all too frequently. Anyone on foot in the vicinity of reversing vehicles and equipment is at risk. More then 20 deathshave occurred on construction-sites over a ten-year period as a result of reversing vehicles. Blind Spots The main problem with reversing vehicles andequipment is the driver or operator's restricted view. Around dump trucks and heavy equipment such as bulldozers and graders there are blind spotswhere the operator has no view or only a verylimited view. The operator may not see someone standing in these blind spots. Anyone kneeling or bending overin these areas would be even harder to see. Consequently the driver or operator must rely on mirrors or signallers to back up without running oversomeone or into something. Figure 1 shows theblind spots for common types of constructionequipment. Dump trucks and cranes are the kinds of equipment that hit overhead powerlines most often. Beware ofpowerline contact whenever a crane, dump truck, orother vehicle is going to be operated near anoverhead electrical conductor. If equipment operateswithin reach of (and could therefore encroach on)the minimum permitted distance from an overheadpowerline (see the chapter on Electrical Hazards inthis manual), the constructor is required to havewritten procedures in place to prevent the equipment from encroaching on the minimu m distance. Accident Prevention To prevent injuries and deaths caused by vehicles and equipment backing up, there are four basic approaches: 1) site planning 2) signallers3) training4) electronic devices. Site planning Wherever possible, site planners should arrange for drive-through operations to reduce the need for vehicles to backup (Figure 2). Foot traffic should be minimized where trucks and equipment operate in congested areas such asexcavations. Where feasible, a barricade can help toBACKING UP Figure 1 – Dark areas indicate operator blind spots.",

    "content": "28 – 2protect workers: for example, by keeping excavation work separate from forming operations (Figure 3). The hazards of reversing vehicles can also be reduced through separate access for workers on foot. Wherepossible, for instance, a scaffold stair system should be provided for worker access to deep excavations. Near loading and unloading areas, pedestrian walkways can be roped off or barricaded. Signallers On some projects, you cannot avoid having reversingvehicles or equipment on-site. Often, they must share anarea with other vehicles and operating equipment – aswell as workers on foot.Y ou must have a signaller or spotter when a) a vehicle or equipment operator’s view of the intended path of travel is obstructed b) a person could be endangered by the operation of the vehicle or equipment, or by its load c) any part of the equipment could encroach on the minimum distance to an overhead powerline (see the chapter on Electrical Hazards in this manual forminimum distances). A signaller must be a competent worker and must nothave any other duties to fulfill while acting as a signaller. Before a worker can act as a signaller, the employer must ensure that the worker has been given adequate oral andwritten instructions in a language that he or sheunderstands. The employer must keep, on-site, a copy ofthe written instructions and a record of the training. A signaller must wear a garment – usually a nylon vest – that is fluorescent or bright orange, with 2 vertical 5-centimetre-wide yellow stripes on the front and 2 similarstripes forming a diagonal \"X\" pattern on the back. Thesestripes must be retro-reflective and fluorescent. The vestmust have an adjustable fit and have a front and side tear-away feature. If a signaller has to work during the night, he or she must wear retro-reflective silver stripes around each arm and leg. The signaller must maintain clear view of the path that the vehicle, machine, or load will be travelling and must beable to watch those parts of the vehicle, equipment, orload that the operator cannot see. The signaller mustmaintain clear and continuous visual contact with theoperator at all times while the vehicle or equipment is moving (Figure 5), and must be able to communicate with the operator using clearly understood, standard handsignals (Figure 6). The signaller must warn other workerson foot of the approaching vehicle or equipment, and mustalert the operator to any hazards along the route. Instruction for drivers,operators, signallers, andworkers on foot is essential toreduce the hazards created byreversing vehicles andequipment. For example, all construction personnel must be madefamiliar with blind spots – theareas around every vehiclethat are partly or completelyinvisible to the operator ordriver, even with the help ofmirrors (Figure 1).

Drivers and Operators • Always obey the signaller or spotter. If more than one person is signalling, stop your vehicle and determine which one to obey. • If possible, remain in the cab in areas where other equipment is likely to be backing up. • Make sure that all mirrors are intact, functional, and properly adjusted for the best view. • Blow the horn twice before backing up.• When no spotter is present, get out and quickly walk around your vehicle. If the way is clear, back up atonce (Figure 8). • Stop the vehicle when a spotter, worker, or anyone else disappears from view. Signallers • Stay alert to recognize and deal with dangerous situations. • Know and use the standard signals for on-site traffic (Figure 6). • Wear a reflective fluorescent or bright orange vest and a bright hard hat for high visibility. • Use a signalling device such as a bullhorn in congested excavation areas. • Understand the maneuvering limitations of vehicles and equipment. • Know driver and operator blind spots.• Stand where you can see and be seen by the driver or operator. • Make eye contact with driver or operator before signalling or changing location. Electronic Equipment Since 2000, automatic audible alarms that signal when a vehicle is being operated in reverse have been requiredon dump trucks. Alarms offer the greatest benefit when traffic is limited to only one or two vehicles. The warning effect of the alarmis greatly reduced, however, when it simply becomes partof the background noise on-site. This is a common shortcoming with devices that sound continuously when the transmission is put in reverse,especially in areas where several vehicles are operatingat once. Newer devices using a type of radar to sense objects or people within a pre-set radius appear to be more effectivebut are not readily available or widely used. Other technologies such as infrared or heat sensors and closed-circuit television are limited by the effects ofvibration, dust, and dirt — conditions all too common onconstruction-sites.BACKING UP Figure 7: This illustration shows how some personnel on foot are visible to the driver while others are not.

This section isdesigned to help you meet the requirement for writteninstructions set out in Section 69(4) of the ConstructionRegulation. A worker who is required to direct vehicular traffic, (a) shall be a competent worker; (b) shall not perform any other work while directing vehicular traffic; (c) shall be positioned in such a way that he or she is endangered as little as possible by vehicular traffic; and (d) shall be given adequate written and oral instructions, in a language that he or she understands, with respect to directing vehicular traffic, and those instructions shall include a description of the signals that are to be used. In addition, the written instructions must be kept on theproject. What are the objectives of traffic • To protect construction workers and the motoring public by regulating traffic flow. • To stop traffic whenever required by the progress of work. Otherwise to keep traffic moving at reduced speeds to avoid tie-ups and delays. • To allow construction to proceed safely and efficiently.• To ensure that public traffic has priority over construction equipment. What equipment do I need? • Hard hat that meets regulated requirements. • Safety boots, CSA-certified, Grade 1 (green triangular CSA patch outside, green rectangular label inside). • Garment, usually a vest, covering upper body and meeting these requirements: Fluorescent or bright orange in colour. Two vertical yellow stripes 5 cm wide on front, covering at least 500 cm2. Two diagonal yellow stripes 5 cm wide on back, in an X pattern, covering at least 570 cm2. Stripes retro. Reflective and fluorescent. Vests to have adjustable fit, and a side and front tear. Away feature on vests made of nylon. We recommend that garments comply with CSA standardZ96. 02—and in particular a Class 2 garment, Level 1 orLevel 2. SignA sign used to direct traffic must be • octagonal in shape, 450 mm wide, and mounted on a pole 1.2 m long • made of material with at least the rigidity of plywood 6 mm thick • high. Intensity retro. Reflective red on one side, with STOP printed in high. Intensity retro. Reflective white150 mm high • on the other side, high. Intensity retro. Reflective micro. Prismatic fluorescent chartreuse, with a black diamond. Shaped border at least 317 mm x 317 mm,with SLOW printed in black 120 mm high. After Dark Section 69.1(4) of the Construction Regulation requires that you wear retro. Reflective silver stripes encircling eacharm and leg, or equivalent side visibility. Enhancing stripeswith a minimum area of 50cm 2per side. The following measures are recommended: • Wear a hard hat with reflective tape. • Use a flashlight with a red cone attachment as well as the sign and carry spare batteries. • Place flashing amber lights ahead of your post.• Stand in a lighted area under temporary or street lighting, or illuminated by light from a parked vehicle(stand fully in the light without creating a silhouette). What are the requirements of a goodtraffic control person? • Sound health, good vision and hearing, mental and physical alertness. • Mature judgment and a pleasant manner.• A good eye for speed and distance to gauge oncoming traffic. • Preferably a driver's licence.• The ability to give motorists simple directions, explain hazards, and answer questions. • Liking, understanding, and respect for the responsibilities of the job. How do I prepare for each job? Before starting work, make sure that you know • the type of construction you will be involved with — paving, installing pipe, grading, cut and fill, etc. • the type of equipment to be used, such as scrapers, trucks, compactors, and graders • how the equipment will be operating — for instance, crossing the road, along the shoulder, in culverts, or on a bridge • whether you will have to protect workers settling up components of the traffic control system such assigns, delineators, cones, and barriers • any special conditions of the contract governing road use (for instance, many contracts forbid work duringurban rush hours) • how public traffic will flow — for example, along a two. Lane highway, around curves or hills, by detour or on aroad narrowed to a single lane. This last is a verycommon situation and requires two traffic control persons to ensure that vehicles do not move in opposing directions at the same time (see next page). In some cases, where the two cannot see oneanother, a third is necessary to keep both in view and relay instructions (see “Positioning of Traffic Control Persons,” next page).TRAFFIC CONTROL.",

Where should I stand? • Stand the correct distance from the work area. Refer to TCP Table on the following page. • Do not stand on the travelled portion of roadway and always face oncoming traffic. • Be alert at all times. Be aware of construction traffic around you and oncoming traffic on the roadway. • Stand alone. Don't allow a group to gather around you.• Stand at your post. Sitting is hazardous because your visibility is reduced and the ability of a motorist to seeyou is reduced. • Adjust distances to suit road, weather and speed conditions. Remember these points: Traffic must have room to react to your directions to stop (a vehicle can take at least twice the stoppingdistance on wet or icy roads). Stand where you can see and be seen by approaching traffic for at least 150 metres (500 feet). Avoid the danger of being backed over or hit by your own equipment. • Hills and curves call for three TCPs or some other means of communication. The job of the TCP in themiddle is to relay signals between the other two. • Once you have been assigned a traffic control position by your supervisor, look over the area formethods of escape — a place to get to in order to avoid being injured by a vehicle heading your way, iffor some reason the driver has disregarded your signals.If this should happen, protect yourself by moving outof the path of the vehicle and then warn the crew.

    "content": "31 – 5TRENCHING Frozen soil does not mean that you can have reduced shoring or that a heavier load can besupported. Frost extends to a limited depth only. Protection Against There are three basic methods of protecting workers against trench cave-ins: • trench boxes• shoring Most fatal cave-ins occur on small jobs of short duration such as service connections andexcavations for drains and wells. Too oftenpeople think that these jobs are not hazardousenough to require safeguards against collapse. Unless the walls are solid rock, never enter a trench deeper than 1.2 metres (4 feet) if it is notproperly sloped, shored, or protected by atrench box. One way to ensure that a trench will notcollapse is to slope the walls. Where space and other requirements permit sloping, the angle of slope depends on soilconditions (Figures 8, 9 and 10). For Type 1 and 2 soils, cut trench walls back at an angle of 1 to 1 (45 degrees). That's onemetre back for each metre up. Walls should besloped to within 1.2 metres (4 feet) of thetrench bottom (Figure 8).For Type 3 soil, cut walls back at a gradient of 1 to 1 from the trench bottom (Figure 9). For Type 4 soil, slope the walls at 1 to 3. That’s 3 metres back for every 1 metre up from thetrench bottom (Figure 10). Although sloping can reduce the risk of a cave-in, the angle must be sufficient to prevent spoil notonly from sliding back but also from exerting toomuch pressure on the trench wall (Figure 11). Sloping is commonly used with shoring or trench boxes to cut back any soil above theprotected zone. It is also good practice to cut abench at the top of the shoring or trench(Figure 12). Moisture affects stability, especially where heavy rainfall has occurred GOOD SOIL Type 1 & 2 Soil Bank Slope Maximum 1.2 m (4 ft.)

Strictlyspeaking, these may not operate hydraulically.Some are air-operated or manually jacked. Designdrawings and specifications for prefabricatedshoring systems must be kept on-site. One major advantage of hydraulic shoring over some applications of timber shoring is safetyduring installation. Workers do not have to enterthe trench to install the system. Installation canbe done from the top of the trench.Most hydraulic systems are • light enough to be installed by one worker • gauge-regulated to ensure even distribution of pressure along the trench line • able to “pre-load” trench walls, thereby using the soil's natural cohesion to prevent • easily adapted to suit various trench depths and widths. Wherever possible, shoring should be installedas excavation proceeds. If there is a delaybetween digging and shoring, no one must beallowed to enter the unprotected trench. All shoring should be installed from the top down and removed from the bottom up. Access/egress Whether protected by sloping, boxes, or shoring,trenches must be provided with ladders so thatworkers can enter and exit safely (Figure 17). Ladders must • be placed within the area protected by the shoring or trench box • be securely tied off at the top• extend above the shoring or box by at least 1 metre (3 feet) Ladders should be placed withinshored area andtied off to preventslipping.",

If the casualty is not breathing, begin artificial respiration immediately(mouth-to-mouth is most efficient) or CPR.Apply cold water to burns and cover withclean dressing. Materials handling Many lost-time injuries in trenching involvematerials handling. Moving rock and soil, liftingpipe and manhole sections, laying downbedding material, or lowering pumps andcompactors into the trench can all be hazardous. Pipe — Trucks should always be on level ground when pipe is unloaded. Pipe should be chocked or staked before tie-downs arereleased. These measures will reduce the risk ofsections rolling off the truck. Plastic and small diameter pipe is often banded with metal straps. Be careful cutting the straps.They are under tension and can fly back and hityou. Personnel often injure fingers and hands when laying and joining sections of pipe. While sectionsare suspended from hoisting equipment, keephands away from slings or chokers in tension.When guiding and pushing sections together byhand, never curl fingers around ends or flanges. As pipe is placed along the trench, each section should be blocked or set so that it cannot rolland cause injury. Back injuries can occur when small-diameter pipe is being homed into position (Figure 29).The worker pushing the bar should place hisfeet directly in front of the pipe with one footahead of the other. Large-diameter pipe should be placed with pipe pullers (Figure 30). Bedding material — Personnel shovelling bedding material in the trench are usually working in a confined area where footing ismuddy and uneven. The result can be overexertion or slips and falls leading to back and other injuries. Mechanicalequipment can significantly reduce this hazard.For instance, bedding material can be put in theexcavator bucket with a front-end loader, thenspread evenly along the trench bottom. Rigging — Rigging is essential to safe, efficient materials handling since pipe, manhole sections,and equipment are lowered into the trench bycranes or other hoisting devices. Rigging these loads properly can prevent injury.Inspect slings and rigging hardware regularly and replace any damaged or worn devices. nylon web slings , damage is usually easy to spot: cuts, holes, tears, worn or distorted fittings, frayed material, broken stitching, heat To maintain balance, keepone foot aheadof the other.",

When using wire rope slings , inspect for broken wires, worn or cracked fittings, loose seizings and splices, flatening, and corrosion.Knots or kinks indicate that wire rope slings arepermanently damaged and should not be used. Damage most often occurs around thimbles and fittings. Don't leave wire rope lying on theground for any length of time in damp or wetconditions. Eyes in wire rope slings should be fitted with thimbles. To make an eye with clips, put the U-bolt section on thedead or short end ofthe rope and thesaddle on the live orlong end (Figure 31).Remember — neversaddle a dead horse. At least three clips are required for wire ropeup to 5/8\" diameter,and four are requiredfor wire rope greaterthan 5/8\" up to andincluding 7/8\"diameter. Avoid binding the eye section of wire ropeslings around corners.The bend will weakenthe splice or swaging. When using choker hitches, do not forcethe eye down towardsthe load once tensionis applied. When using chain slings, inspect for elongated links. A badly stretched link tends to close up (Figure 32). Look for bent, twisted, or damaged links that can result when chain has been used to lift aload with unprotected sharp edges. Inspect for cracks. Although sometimes hard to detect, cracks always indicate that the chainshould be removed from service. Also look forgouges, chips, cuts, dents, peen marks, andcorrosive wear at points where links bear oneach other. Rigging Tips • Wherever possible, lower loads on adequate blockage to prevent damage toslings. • Keep hands away from pinch points when slack is being taken up. • Stand clear while the load is being lifted and lowered or when slings are beingpulled out from under it. • Use tag lines to control swinging, swaying, or other unwanted movement ofthe load. Housekeeping Accident prevention depends on properhousekeeping at ground level and in the trench. At the top of the trench, sections of pipe, unused tools and timber, piles of spoil, andother material must be kept at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from the edge. The slips and falls common on excavation projects can be reduced by cleaning up scrapand debris. Trenches should also be kept as dryas possible.

The best prevention is to maintain3-point contact (Figure 34). Equipment should be fitted with steps, grabs, and rails that are repaired or replaced whendamaged. Operators have also suffered serious injuries when equipment upsets because of soil failurenear excavations (Figure 35), improper loadingon floats, or inadvertently backing intoexcavations. Use 3-point contact on steps and rails. Try to push backfill into excavation rather thandumping it. Ladders should be placed within shoredarea and tied off to prevent slipping.",

    "content": "31 – 17TRENCHING Moving equipment — Signallers are required • if the operator's view of the intended path of travel is obstructed, or • if a person could be endangered by the moving equipment or its load. Back-up alarms are required on dump trucks and recommended for all moving equipment.Where vehicles have to operate in reverse,warning signs must be conspicuously posted. Ground rules for truck drivers • Understand and obey the signaller at all • Remain in the cab where possible. • Ensure that mirrors are clean, functional, and properly adjusted. • Do a circle check after being away from the truck for any length of time (walk around the truck to ensure the area is clear beforemoving). • Stop immediately when a signaller, worker, or anyone else disappears from view. Workers on foot — Personnel on foot are frequently stuck by machine attachments such as excavator buckets and bulldozer blades whenthey stand or work too close to operatingequipment, especially during unloading andexcavation. Workers on foot are also injured and killed by equipment backing up. Ground rules for workers on foot • Beware of common operator blind spots. See chapter on Backing Up in this manual. • Stay alert to the location of equipment around you. • Avoid entering or standing in blind spots. • Always remain visible to the operator.Make eye contact to ensure that youare seen. • Never stand behind a backing vehicle. • Remember — the operator may be able to see you while you are standing but not when you kneel down or bend over. Signallers — In heavily travelled or congested work areas, a signaller may be necessary to direct equipment and prevent injuries anddeaths caused by vehicles backing up. Ground rules for signallers • Wear a fluorescent or bright orange safety vest. • Use standard hand signals (Figure 37). • Stand where you can see and be seen.• Stay in full view of the operator and the intended path of travel. • Know where the operator's blind spots • Warn other workers to stay clear of equipment.

Breathing — Ensure that the casualty is breathing. If not, open the airway and startartificial respiration immediately. Mouth-to-mouth is the most efficient method. Bleeding — Control external bleeding by applying direct pressure, placing the casualty ina comfortable position, and elevating the injuredpart if possible. Unconsciousness — This is a priority because it may lead to breathing problems. Anunconscious person may suffocate when leftlying face up. If injuries permit, unconsciouspersons who must be left unattended should beplaced in the recovery position (Figure 41). Recovery position.",

    "content": "32 – 2Safe Handling of Cylinders In construction, most propane applications dispense the fuel in a vapour form. For this reason it is essential thatportable cylinders be transported, stored, and used in anupright position. Propane liquid must never come incontact with the cylinder relief valve. If liquid escapesthrough the valve, large volumes of gas will be released.On a construction heater, for example, this can cause aserious overburn with flames extending many feet past theburner tip. The simplest way to avoid the problem is to fasten cylinders in an upright position with rope, wire, or othermeans. When transporting by truck, take extra care tokeep cylinders upright and stationary. Cylinders should notbe transported in an automobile trunk or in a closed van.Because propane is heavier than air, escaping gas cancollect in a confined space and create an explosiveatmosphere, as well as threaten life by displacingbreathable air. Store cylinders safely on the jobsite. They should be stored away from buildings, preferably in a separatecompound out of traffic areas and where they are in nodanger of being struck by falling materials or movingequipment. A simple compound can be constructed usinga length of snow fence and a few T -bars (Figure 2). Whenproperly constructed, this barrier provides a means oftying up the cylinders as well as controlling stock.Cylinders should not be stored closer than 25 feet to aproperty line. Empty cylinders should be stored on oneside, full on the other. Don't mix the cylinders. The compound should not be close to an area where flammable liquids such as gasoline and diesel fuel arestored. Only cylinders that are in use should be inside a building. (“In use” means hooked up to a construction heater or other appliance.) Propane must not be stored inside a building unless in a specially constructedexplosion-proof room, which meets thepropane and fire codes. Do notlocate cylinders in stairwells andhallways. Leaking gas or theoutbreak of fire can blockexits and prevent escape. When moving cylinders of gas around thejobsite, rememberthe followingprecautions.• Keep cylinders upright. Use a hand cart (Figure 3). Never roll cylinders. • Use a hoisting cradle to move cylinders from one level to another(Figure 4). • Never use a sling. This practice is prohibited by the ConstructionRegulation under the Occupational Health and Safety • Never hook onto the protective collar around the valve. • Keep cylinders away from heat sources. Y ou must have a record of training (ROT) recognized bythe Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA)before you can hook up and light a propane-fired heater. When hooking up and using construction heaters, observe the following precautions. • All connections must be made by a competent worker. • Inspect burner, controls, regulator, and hose for defects. Have any damaged parts repaired or replaced. Gas-burningequipment should only be repaired bylicensed service personnel. • Make sure all hose and valve connections are clean. • Use fitting wrenches to make connections. Don't use adjustable pipe wrenches. • Cylinders should be at least 10 feet away from the heaters. The cylinder should be placed well clear ofany heat source and never at the flame end of aheater. • Have a 4A40BC fire extinguisher on hand before lighting the heater. • When connections are made, slowly open the cylinder valve and check for leaks when the hose line is full ofgas. Cylinder valves in use must be fully opened.Check for leaks with soapywater (Figure 6) or a leakdetector. Sometimes you maynotice a gas odour or frostappearing on a fitting, butthese signs are not alwaysreliable. If a leak isdetected, shut off thecylinder valve and makecorrections. Fully closevalves when not in use. • If the cylinder valve is opened too quickly it mayPROPANE Simple but secure on-site storage Secure the cylinder and keep it at least 10 feet away from the heater. Hose length must be between 15 feet and 50 feet. Figure 6: Soap Test for LeaksDistance: 10 ft. min. Hose: 15 ft. min., 50 ft. max.",
