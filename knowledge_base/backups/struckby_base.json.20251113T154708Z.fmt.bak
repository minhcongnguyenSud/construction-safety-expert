Consult section 153 of the\nconstruction regulation before using this option\nto rescue a worker.\nAlso, consider the following factors:\n• A crane operator must be readily available to\noperate the crane.\n• The basket used must be designed by a\nprofessional engineer in accordance with\ngood manufacturing processes to withstand\nall loads to which it may be subjected.\n• The basket must be kept on site at all times\nin an accessible location where it is clear of\nmaterial or other equipment.\n• The rescue basket must be equipped with\nappropriate rigging for quick hookup by the\ncrane operator.\n• The maximum number of people the basket\nmay hold must be adhered to, as indicated\non the nameplate of the basket.\n• A competent worker must inspect the crane\nand equipment prior to lifting rescuers.\n• The crane must be equipped with a fail-\nsafe mechanism to prevent the boom from\ndescending in the event of a power source or\nsystem failure.\n• An adequate means of communication must\nbe maintained between the rescuers in the\nbasket and the crane operator at all times.\n• Workers in the rescue basket must wear full-\nbody harnesses attached to a lanyard and\nanchored to appropriate points in the basket\nat all times.\n• All rigging used to attach the rescue basket\nto the hook of a load line must have a safety\nfactor of 10 against failure. A safety line must\nbe attached to the load line directly from the\n• Environmental factors that could impact the\nsafety of workers in the basket must be taken\ninto consideration, such as high winds, snow,\nice, or sleet.NOTE: Basket rescue with a crane may not\nbe possible in circumstances where the deck\nadvances over floors.\nC. Using an elevating work platform\nIn some cases an elevating work platform\n(EWP) could be to rescue a worker from the\nuppermost work level. The EWP must be\npositioned on the floor below the uppermost\nwork level and in an area above which\nan opening exists that is large enough to\naccommodate its platform when raised into\nIn the event that a worker needs to be rescued,\nthe platform can be raised to the opening and\nthe worker can be moved onto its platform.\nThe platform is lowered to a position where\nrescue personnel can safely remove the worker\nfrom the workplace.\nBefore using this rescue method, consult\nsections 143–149 of the construction regulation\n(213/91). Also, be aware that the EWP must be\ncontinuously hoisted to the floor below the\nuppermost work level.\nD. Using a mechanical rescue/descent device\nMechanically assisted rescue devices can be\nused to lower a worker from the uppermost\nlevel of a suspended slab to a lower level\nwhere rescue personnel can get to the worker\nand provide medical aid as necessary. These\nsystems typically require workers on the\nuppermost level to wear a full-body harness.\nRescue personnel attach the device’s lifeline\nfrom an anchor point to the D-ring on the\nworker’s full-body harness. The worker is then\nlowered to a more accessible work platform.\nAlways consult the manufacturer’s instructions\nbefore using this type of equipment.\nFigure 2-5: EWPs Can Be Used During RescueKnow the Law\n75. (2) As the construction of a building or\nstructure progresses, permanent or temporary\nstairs shall be installed up to,\n(a) the uppermost work level; or\n(b) if stairs would interfere with work on\nthe uppermost work level, no more than two\nstoreys or nine metres below the uppermost\nwork level, whichever distance is shorter.\n– O.

More then 20 deathshave occurred on construction sites over a ten-year period as a result of reversing vehicles.\nBlind Spots\nThe main problem with reversing vehicles andequipment is the driver or operator's restricted view.\nAround dump trucks and heavy equipment such\nas bulldozers and graders there are blind spotswhere the operator has no view or only a verylimited view.\nThe operator may not see someone standing in\nthese blind spots. Anyone kneeling or bending overin these areas would be even harder to see.\nConsequently the driver or operator must rely on\nmirrors or signallers to back up without running oversomeone or into something. Figure 1 shows theblind spots for common types of constructionequipment.\nDump trucks and cranes are the kinds of equipment\nthat hit overhead powerlines most often. Beware ofpowerline contact whenever a crane, dump truck, orother vehicle is going to be operated near anoverhead electrical conductor. If equipment operateswithin reach of (and could therefore encroach on)the minimum permitted distance from an overheadpowerline (see the chapter on Electrical Hazards inthis manual), the constructor is required to havewritten procedures in place to prevent the equipment\nfrom encroaching on the minimu m distance.\nAccident Prevention\nTo prevent injuries and deaths caused by vehicles and\nequipment backing up, there are four basic approaches:\n1) site planning\n2) signallers3) training4) electronic devices.\nSite planning\nWherever possible, site planners should arrange for drive-through operations to reduce the need for vehicles to backup (Figure 2).\nFoot traffic should be minimized where trucks and\nequipment operate in congested areas such asexcavations.

Wherepossible, for instance, a scaffold stair system should be\nprovided for worker access to deep excavations.\nNear loading and unloading areas, pedestrian walkways\ncan be roped off or barricaded.\nSignallers\nOn some projects, you cannot avoid having reversingvehicles or equipment on site. Often, they must share anarea with other vehicles and operating equipment – aswell as workers on foot.Y ou must have a signaller or spotter when\na) a vehicle or equipment operator’s view of the intended\npath of travel is obstructed\nb) a person could be endangered by the operation of the\nvehicle or equipment, or by its load\nc) any part of the equipment could encroach on the\nminimum distance to an overhead powerline (see the\nchapter on Electrical Hazards in this manual forminimum distances).\nA signaller must be a competent worker and must nothave any other duties to fulfill while acting as a signaller.\nBefore a worker can act as a signaller, the employer must\nensure that the worker has been given adequate oral andwritten instructions in a language that he or sheunderstands. The employer must keep, on site, a copy ofthe written instructions and a record of the training.\nA signaller must wear a garment – usually a nylon vest –\nthat is fluorescent or bright orange, with 2 vertical 5-centimetre-wide yellow stripes on the front and 2 similarstripes forming a diagonal \"X\" pattern on the back. Thesestripes must be retro-reflective and fluorescent. The vestmust have an adjustable fit and have a front and side tear-away feature.\nIf a signaller has to work during the night, he or she must\nwear retro-reflective silver stripes around each arm and leg.\nThe signaller must maintain clear view of the path that the\nvehicle, machine, or load will be travelling and must beable to watch those parts of the vehicle, equipment, orload that the operator cannot see. The signaller mustmaintain clear and continuous visual contact with theoperator at all times while the vehicle or equipment is\nmoving (Figure 5), and must be able to communicate with\nthe operator using clearly understood, standard handsignals (Figure 6). The signaller must warn other workerson foot of the approaching vehicle or equipment, and mustalert the operator to any hazards along the route.\nInstruction for drivers,operators, signallers, andworkers on foot is essential toreduce the hazards created byreversing vehicles andequipment.\nFor example, all construction\npersonnel must be madefamiliar with blind spots – theareas around every vehiclethat are partly or completelyinvisible to the operator ordriver, even with the help ofmirrors (Figure 1).\nSpecific training can then focus\non the following points.BACKING UP\nClearanceStop\nChange directionFigure 6",

Frost extends to a limited depth only.\nProtection Against\nThere are three basic methods of protecting\nworkers against trench cave-ins:\n• trench boxes• shoring\nMost fatal cave-ins occur on small jobs of short\nduration such as service connections andexcavations for drains and wells. Too oftenpeople think that these jobs are not hazardousenough to require safeguards against collapse.\nUnless the walls are solid rock, never enter a\ntrench deeper than 1.2 metres (4 feet) if it is notproperly sloped, shored, or protected by atrench box.\nOne way to ensure that a trench will notcollapse is to slope the walls.\nWhere space and other requirements permit\nsloping, the angle of slope depends on soilconditions (Figures 8, 9 and 10).\nFor Type 1 and 2 soils, cut trench walls back at\nan angle of 1 to 1 (45 degrees). That's onemetre back for each metre up. Walls should besloped to within 1.2 metres (4 feet) of thetrench bottom (Figure 8).For Type 3 soil, cut walls back at a gradient of 1\nto 1 from the trench bottom (Figure 9).\nFor Type 4 soil, slope the walls at 1 to 3. That’s\n3 metres back for every 1 metre up from thetrench bottom (Figure 10).\nAlthough sloping can reduce the risk of a cave-in,\nthe angle must be sufficient to prevent spoil notonly from sliding back but also from exerting toomuch pressure on the trench wall (Figure 11).\nSloping is commonly used with shoring or\ntrench boxes to cut back any soil above theprotected zone. It is also good practice to cut abench at the top of the shoring or trench(Figure 12).\nMoisture affects stability, especially where heavy rainfall has occurred\nGOOD SOIL Type 1 & 2 Soil\nBank Slope Maximum\n1.2 m (4 ft.)\nFigure 9FAIRLY GOOD SOILType 3 Soil\nBank Slope\nBAD SOIL Type 4 Soil\nBank Slope\nSpoil piles can exert too much pressure on sloped trench wall.",

Strictlyspeaking, these may not operate hydraulically.Some are air-operated or manually jacked. Designdrawings and specifications for prefabricatedshoring systems must be kept on site.\nOne major advantage of hydraulic shoring over\nsome applications of timber shoring is safetyduring installation. Workers do not have to enterthe trench to install the system. Installation canbe done from the top of the trench.Most hydraulic systems are\n• light enough to be installed by one worker\n• gauge-regulated to ensure even distribution\nof pressure along the trench line\n• able to “pre-load” trench walls, thereby\nusing the soil's natural cohesion to prevent\n• easily adapted to suit various trench depths\nand widths.\nWherever possible, shoring should be installedas excavation proceeds.

Moving rock and soil, liftingpipe and manhole sections, laying downbedding material, or lowering pumps andcompactors into the trench can all be hazardous.\nPipe — Trucks should always be on level\nground when pipe is unloaded. Pipe should be\nchocked or staked before tie-downs arereleased. These measures will reduce the risk ofsections rolling off the truck.\nPlastic and small diameter pipe is often banded\nwith metal straps. Be careful cutting the straps.They are under tension and can fly back and hityou.\nPersonnel often injure fingers and hands when\nlaying and joining sections of pipe. While sectionsare suspended from hoisting equipment, keephands away from slings or chokers in tension.When guiding and pushing sections together byhand, never curl fingers around ends or flanges.\nAs pipe is placed along the trench, each section\nshould be blocked or set so that it cannot rolland cause injury.\nBack injuries can occur when small-diameter\npipe is being homed into position (Figure 29).The worker pushing the bar should place hisfeet directly in front of the pipe with one footahead of the other.\nLarge-diameter pipe should be placed with pipe\npullers (Figure 30).\nBedding material — Personnel shovelling\nbedding material in the trench are usually\nworking in a confined area where footing ismuddy and uneven.\nThe result can be overexertion or slips and falls\nleading to back and other injuries. Mechanicalequipment can significantly reduce this hazard.For instance, bedding material can be put in theexcavator bucket with a front-end loader, thenspread evenly along the trench bottom.\nRigging — Rigging is essential to safe, efficient\nmaterials handling since pipe, manhole sections,and equipment are lowered into the trench bycranes or other hoisting devices.\nRigging these loads properly can prevent injury.Inspect slings and rigging hardware regularly\nand replace any damaged or worn devices.\nnylon web slings , damage is usually\neasy to spot: cuts, holes, tears, worn or distorted\nfittings, frayed material, broken stitching, heat\nTo maintain\nbalance, keepone foot aheadof the other.",

    "content": "32 – 2Safe Handling of Cylinders\nIn construction, most propane applications dispense the\nfuel in a vapour form. For this reason it is essential thatportable cylinders be transported, stored, and used in anupright position. Propane liquid must never come incontact with the cylinder relief valve. If liquid escapesthrough the valve, large volumes of gas will be released.On a construction heater, for example, this can cause aserious overburn with flames extending many feet past theburner tip.\nThe simplest way to avoid the problem is to fasten\ncylinders in an upright position with rope, wire, or othermeans. When transporting by truck, take extra care tokeep cylinders upright and stationary. Cylinders should notbe transported in an automobile trunk or in a closed van.Because propane is heavier than air, escaping gas cancollect in a confined space and create an explosiveatmosphere, as well as threaten life by displacingbreathable air.\nStore cylinders safely on the jobsite. They should be\nstored away from buildings, preferably in a separatecompound out of traffic areas and where they are in nodanger of being struck by falling materials or movingequipment. A simple compound can be constructed usinga length of snow fence and a few T -bars (Figure 2). Whenproperly constructed, this barrier provides a means oftying up the cylinders as well as controlling stock.Cylinders should not be stored closer than 25 feet to aproperty line. Empty cylinders should be stored on oneside, full on the other. Don't mix the cylinders.\nThe compound should not be close to an area where\nflammable liquids such as gasoline and diesel fuel arestored. Only cylinders that are in use should be inside\na building. (“In use” means hooked up to a construction\nheater or other appliance.)\nPropane must not be stored inside a\nbuilding unless in a specially constructedexplosion-proof room, which meets thepropane and fire codes. Do notlocate cylinders in stairwells andhallways. Leaking gas or theoutbreak of fire can blockexits and prevent escape.\nWhen moving cylinders\nof gas around thejobsite, rememberthe followingprecautions.• Keep cylinders upright. Use a hand cart (Figure 3).\nNever roll cylinders.\n• Use a hoisting cradle to move\ncylinders from one level to another(Figure 4).\n• Never use a sling. This practice is\nprohibited by the ConstructionRegulation under the\nOccupational Health and Safety\n• Never hook onto the protective\ncollar around the valve.\n• Keep cylinders away from heat sources.\nY ou must have a record of training (ROT) recognized bythe Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA)before you can hook up and light a propane-fired heater.\nWhen hooking up and using construction heaters, observe\nthe following precautions.\n• All connections must be made by a\ncompetent worker.\n• Inspect burner, controls, regulator, and\nhose for defects. Have any damaged parts\nrepaired or replaced. Gas-burningequipment should only be repaired bylicensed service personnel.\n• Make sure all hose and valve connections\nare clean.\n• Use fitting wrenches to make connections.\nDon't use adjustable pipe wrenches.\n• Cylinders should be at least 10 feet away from the\nheaters. The cylinder should be placed well clear ofany heat source and never at the flame end of aheater.\n• Have a 4A40BC fire extinguisher on hand before\nlighting the heater.\n• When connections are made, slowly open the cylinder\nvalve and check for leaks when the hose line is full ofgas. Cylinder valves in use must be fully opened.Check for leaks with soapywater (Figure 6) or a leakdetector. Sometimes you maynotice a gas odour or frostappearing on a fitting, butthese signs are not alwaysreliable. If a leak isdetected, shut off thecylinder valve and makecorrections. Fully closevalves when not in use.\n• If the cylinder valve is\nopened too quickly it mayPROPANE\nSimple but secure on-site storage\nSecure the cylinder and keep it at least 10 feet away from the\nheater.
